<span class="fs80">IN THE RAIN</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A seven-fifty</span> derby, new only that afternoon
and destined already to be reblocked! Ex-roundsman
Timothy McCarty, whose complete transition to
civilian attire was still so recent as to be a source of
satisfaction to himself and of despair to his tailor and
haberdasher, shrugged his broad shoulders and trudged
sturdily along in the teeming downpour. A walk he had
come out for, to clear his head of all that psycho-junk
he’d been reading, and a walk he would have, but he
could think of a place the devil could take this rain to,
where it would be better appreciated!</p>

<p>Rain dripped down upon a sodden wisp of tobacco
which hung dejectedly from beneath his mustache, and
muddy streams spurted up almost to his knees with every
step. It was a mean district, a neighborhood of broken,
narrow sidewalks, dilapidated tenements and squalid
wooden shacks, which became more squalid as McCarty
neared the river, although here great warehouses loomed
against the lesser darkness of the night sky. It was
barely nine o’clock but there was scarcely a light in the
streets, except where irregularly spaced street lamps
emitted a blurred glimmer which emphasized rather than
dispelled the murky gloom, yet McCarty strode on with
the unconcern of one treading a once-familiar precinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>He was not the only pedestrian abroad in the late
September storm. Under the glow of a lamp he presently
descried a dark figure proceeding also in the direction
of the waterfront, and insensibly he quickened his
own steps. Some peculiarity in the latter’s gait had
aroused that suspicion, more than mere curiosity, that had
served him so well in the old days on the Force.</p>

<p>The man was lurching along at an unsteady pace,
now breaking into a shambling trot for a few steps, now
pulling up short, only to dive forward once more, reeling
through the driving sheets of rain. McCarty followed
closely. He had almost overtaken the man when a tall,
bluecoated figure stepped suddenly from the shelter of a
doorway and barred his progress.</p>

<p>“None of that, my lad! For what are you following
that feller there—? Glory be, it’s Mac!”</p>

<p>“True for you, Terry!” McCarty responded, as their
hands met in a mighty grip. “A fine, conscientious bull
you are, I’ll say that for you, pinching the old has-been
that got you on the Force, just because he’s taking a bit
of a stroll on a grand night like this!”</p>

<p>Officer Terrence Keenan grinned sheepishly in the
darkness.</p>

<p>“It’s a grand night, all right; for ducks!” he amended.
“You’re no has-been, Mac, from what the boys tell me of
the different cases you’ve taken a hand in on the quiet
since you resigned from the Department, but you needn’t
give me the laugh for looking you over just now! You
know this neighborhood as well as me, and when I see
a guy trailing a prosperous looking drunk towards the
riverfront and the wharves it’s up to me—”</p>

<p>“‘Drunk,’ is it?” McCarty demanded in fine scorn.
Then he checked himself and added with a sweeping gesture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
toward the greenish glow from twin lights across
the street: “I was minded to take a stroll through my
own old beat and drop in at the house over there for a
word or two with you and the Lieutenant at the desk,
when I saw the guy ahead—but where is he? He couldn’t
have got in one of the warehouses at this time of the
evening and there’s nothing else between here and the
corner—?”</p>

<p>“Aw, let him go!” Officer Keenan interrupted good-naturedly.
“Honest, Mac, I ain’t got the heart to run
them in these days, when the stuff is so hard to get, and
all—!”</p>

<p>But McCarty was not listening. Forgotten alike were
the bedraggled derby and the affluent private life of which
it had so lately been sign and symbol; he was back on his
old beat with something doing, and he grabbed his brother
officer by the arm.</p>

<p>“What’s that there beyond the lamp-post, half in and
half out of the gutter? It’s him, Terry, he’s down!—Come
on!”</p>

<p>Terry needed no second bidding now. Together they
ran, splashing through puddles and over the loose, tilting
fragments of pavement to where the man lay. He had
pitched forward, his face hanging over the curb’s edge,
down into the swirling gutter. The back of his head
showed a bald spot gleaming in the misty rays from the
lamp.</p>

<p>“There’s some heft to him!” Terry grunted. “Now
I’ll have to run him in for safe-keeping. What’s that
he’s jabbering, Mac?”</p>

<p>Between them they had turned the prostrate man, who
was breathing stertorously and muttering to himself in
broken gasps. The young policeman’s flashlight revealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
a heavy, smooth-shaven face, distorted and pasty gray
beneath the rivulets of muddy water that coursed down
it, with small, close-set eyes darting about in a wild, distended
gaze.</p>

<p>McCarty bent lower in an effort to distinguish the
hoarse accents. His companion commented disgustedly:</p>

<p>“He’s worse than I thought he was! Look at the
rolling eyes of him! It’ll be Bellevue, I’m thinking—”</p>

<p>“Hush!” McCarty commanded, as he lifted the man’s
head higher on his knee. His breathing had become a
series of heaving gasps now. Suddenly, with a rumbling
snort, they ceased altogether, the flabby jaw sagging as
the lids drooped.</p>

<p>“Not Bellevue, Terry; the morgue, more likely.”
McCarty spoke solemnly. “He’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Croaked!” Terry started up. “It sure looks like
it! I’ll run across to the house and tip off the lieut. and
put in the ambulance call. You’ll wait here?”</p>

<p>Without pausing for a reply he turned and splashed
heavily across the street to the station house. McCarty
looked down at the figure still propped against his knee.
In the feeble light of the street lamp it appeared to be
muffled to the neck in a loose, dark ulster of some thin
material. The body was portly though not actually
stout; the upturned face, washed clean of the mud from
the gutter, was a grayish blur, its hideous distortion of
feature relaxed, leaving it a mere flaccid mass. Some
involuntary movement of the supporting knee caused the
head to slump forward on the dead man’s breast and once
more that small, round bald spot gleamed whitely from the
scant, dark hair surrounding it.</p>

<p>“Mike Taggart—he’s lieutenant now, as you may
know,—says it’ll be all right to bring the body over there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
without waiting out on such a night for the ambulance.”
Terry had waded back through the reeking mire. “He’d
be glad of a word with you, too, Mac, so will you give
me a hand with the old boy here? It’s only a step.”</p>

<p>With a slight shrug and a smile that was lost upon his
companion McCarty assumed his share of their limp burden.
Together they bore it across the street to the
station house. He blinked in the sudden glare of light,
as the sodden figure was deposited on the floor, and then
turned to greet the homely, spruce young giant who had
come forward from behind the desk.</p>

<p>“So it’s Lieutenant Taggart now, that was a rookie
when I left the Force!” he exclaimed with a laugh. “I’d
thought to drop in on you one of these days but not as
part of the escort for our friend here!”</p>

<p>He motioned over his shoulder toward the body and
the lieutenant shook hands with obvious respect before
advancing to examine it.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, McCarty, though you do come in
strange company!” He smiled and then turned to Officer
Keenan who had knelt and was running his hands
over the inanimate form in a practiced manner.
“Humph! Looks like a pretty prosperous sort of a bird
to be hanging around the waterfront on a night like
this, don’t he? What do you find on him, Terry? I
don’t believe I ever saw that face in this precinct before.”</p>

<p>As the policeman turned over to his superior the contents
of the dead man’s pockets, McCarty stood gazing
thoughtfully down upon him. He was apparently in the
late forties and in life the beefy, extremely close-shaven
face might have been florid; the nose was short but highly
arched and the lids which had opened now revealed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
small, pale eyes set in a dull stare. His raincoat, of excellent
texture, had been opened to admit of Terry’s
search, and disclosed a dark brown sack suit and tie of the
same grade of conservative excellence as the outer garment,
but the low brown shoes that covered the large,
rather flat feet were as incongruously inferior as they
were blatantly new. The man’s hands were outstretched
limply, palms upward, with the thick though well-kept
fingers curling slightly, and McCarty’s keen eyes narrowed
a little as they rested on them. Then he turned.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, I think I saw his hat go sailing off down
the gutter as we carried him across. Shall I get it while
you and my friend Terry, here, go over his effects?”</p>

<p>“Wish you would, McCarty.” The lieutenant glanced
up absently from the desk where he and Keenan were
sorting out a collection of small articles. “You must
take a flash at these when you come back.”</p>

<p>McCarty nodded and departed upon his self-elected
errand, appropriating the flashlight which the policeman
had laid on a chair. He proceeded to the opposite
side of the street and measuring off with his eye the
distance from the lamp-post to where the fallen man’s
head had rested over the curb, he followed the racing
gutter for several yards down past the further warehouse
to where the turbid flow was separated by a pile of refuse.
There, impaled on a barrel stave, he found the sodden,
shapeless brown mass that had once been a soft felt hat,
and retrieving it, he carefully examined the inner side of
the crown with the aid of the flashlight. The gilt lettering
denoting the maker on the sweatband was so soaked
as to be illegible but two initials showed plainly in the
tiny, gleaming ray:—‘B. P.’</p>

<p>With his trophy McCarty returned to the station house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
to find Keenan and his superior with their heads together
over a key-ring.</p>

<p>“There’s the hat, or what’s left of it.” He deposited
the drenched article beside the body on the floor as he
spoke. “Terry, here, was watching the guy pass him
and he says he was hooched up for fair, so likely there’ll
be nothing further come of this after his folks haul him
away from the morgue, but if I’m wanted to swear that
’twas bootleg lightning and not the regular kind hit him,
Inspector Druet or any of the old crowd at headquarters
will know where to find me. I’ll be getting on home, for
I’m soaked to the skin—”</p>

<p>“Take a look at these first, McCarty,” the lieutenant
invited. “Hooch or no hooch, I’m going to find out
what this bird was doing in my precinct! If that
jewelry’s phoney it don’t go with the rest of his outfit
and if it’s real, what was he doing down this way with it
on? Don’t make any crack about his relying on us to
protect him, for you walked your beat here yourself in the
old days and the district hasn’t changed much! What do
you make of it?”</p>

<p>McCarty turned over the articles presented for his inspection
with a carelessly critical air.</p>

<p>“Handkerchief, kid gloves, Wareham gold-filled watch,
pigskin cigar case with two broken cigars in it, sixty—seventy
dollars and eighty cents in change,” McCarty
enumerated rapidly. “Nothing here marked and no
letters nor papers, eh? That scarf pin and those cuff
buttons, fakes or not, are what they call cat’s-eyes, I’m
thinking. Is that all except the key-ring?”</p>

<p>“It is, but if this bird purposely intended to leave everything
off that would give him away to whoever he was
going to meet, he slipped up! Look at here!” Lieutenant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Taggart spoke with an air of triumph as he separated
the keys of all shapes and sizes on the ring to disclose a
small, thin, much-worn disk of some dull metal, one side
of which bore the single numeral ‘4,’ and the reverse three
letters in old English script:—‘N. Q. M.’</p>

<p>McCarty’s stubby mustache moved slightly as his lips
tightened, but he shook his head.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked. “I’d say it looked like one of
those identification tags in case he lost his keys, but if
‘N. Q. M.’ are his initials, what is the ‘4’?”</p>

<p>The young lieutenant regarded him almost pityingly.</p>

<p>“It was not meant for an identification tag exactly,
McCarty; at least, not for any stranger that might happen
to pick up these keys, but it’ll tell me more than just who
this bird is and where he lived before I’m through!”</p>

<p>“I hope so, lad!” But McCarty still shook his head.
“Happen, though, when the body is claimed you’ll find
he was Neil Quinn Malone, walking delegate for Stevedores’
Union Number Four, and down here late for a
date because of meeting up with some bootlegger’s first
cousins!”</p>

<p>“There’s the ambulance!” Terry spoke suddenly as a
bell clanged up the street. His honest face had reddened
and his tone was a mixture of forbearance and chagrin.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll take the air, boys,—and the rain!” McCarty
sternly repressed the twinkle in his eyes. “I’m chilled to
the marrow of me, which does no good to the touch of
rheumatism I’ve had lately, and I need no young sawbones
in a white coat to tell me that guy is dead, even
though there’s never a mark on him! Good luck to the
two of you!”</p>

<p>He made his way out into the storm, bending his head
before the pelting downpour and chuckling as he turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the coat collar up about his throat. The good lads back
there would think that a few years of soft living had
done for old Mac, and he was through!</p>

<p>Yet he was not chuckling when he turned into a dingy
little lunchroom a few blocks away and in the look which
he bent upon his coffee cup there was more of uneasy indecision
than its steaming but doubtful contents warranted.
He <em>was</em> through, though not in the way Terry
and Taggart might be thinking. Never again would he
intrude on a case that belonged to the department he had
quitted! The methods had changed too much since his
day when a plainclothes bull went out and got his man or
was hauled up on the carpet to explain why not; it was
bad enough when Headquarters began to be cluttered up
with all that scientific crime detecting junk from the
foreign police centers, but now they were opening up a
school to teach this black art called “criminal psycho-analysis”
to a bunch of fine lads in the detective bureau
who needed nothing but the quick minds and strong arms
that the Lord had given them already! It was his own
secret and shamefaced perusal of such books on this subject
as he had been able to gather, that had driven him
forth with a case of mental blind staggers earlier that
very evening. Well, let them psycho-analyze that man
who carried the queer tag on his key-ring! And yet—!</p>

<p>It was a rare case! McCarty’s eyes glistened and his
nostrils fairly quivered with the old eagerness as he considered
its possibilities. His coffee finished, he took the
nearest subway that led to the rooms over the antique
shop where he maintained a solitary bachelor establishment.</p>

<p>He had expected to find it empty as usual but to his
surprise he noted that a low light glowed from behind the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
shades of his two front windows and on opening the entrance
door with his latchkey he was greeted by a particularly
malodorous stench of tobacco wafted down the narrow
stairway. There wasn’t another pipe in the world
that smelt quite like that one, and as he bounded upward
he called:</p>

<p>“Denny! If I hadn’t thought you were on duty at the
engine house—!”</p>

<p>No reply came to him, however. He rounded the stairs’
head and then paused in amazement on the threshold of
his shabby, comfortable living-room. Dennis Riordan,
engine driver from the nearest fire house and his particular
crony since they had landed from the Old Country,
was totally oblivious to his presence. He sprawled in
the low Morris chair with a book in his hands, and his
long legs writhed while his lantern-jawed face was contorted
in the agony of mental concentration.</p>

<p>“Denny! Snap out of it!” his unheeded host commanded.
“What in the name of all that’s—!”</p>

<p>Denny “snapped.” He dropped the book and sat up
with a jerk, his eyes blinking.</p>

<p>“So you’re back,” he remarked dazedly. “’Tis small
wonder I’ve seen little of you these days since you’ve
taken to literature! Newspapers have been your limit
up till now but here I use the latchkey you gave me, thinking
to get in out of the rain whilst I’m waiting for you,
and I find these books. Man, they’re fair wonderful!—But
what do they mean?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet and I misdoubt the guys who wrote
them do!” McCarty’s tone was almost savage as he deposited
his dripping hat tenderly on the corner of the
mantel and peeled off the sodden topcoat. “Which one
had you there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“‘The Diagnostics of Penology.’” Denny picked up
the volume once more and read the title laboriously. “I
thought a ‘diagnostic’ was an unbeliever and you’d taken
to religion in your declining years, but ’tis all about the
different kinds of criminals. I never knew there was
but one—a crook!”</p>

<p>“No more did I.” McCarty lighted a cigar reflectively.
“There must be something in it, though, for that’s the
stuff the commissioner is going to get through the heads
of the boys at headquarters in this new school of his.”</p>

<p>“Is it, now!” Dennis’ tone held a touch of awe. “Do
you mean that all they’ll have to do when a crime’s
committed will be to sit down and figure out whether the
lad who pulled it off was a lunatic, maybe, or ’twas born
in him, or a matter of habit or the only time he’d try it, or
else that he’d been brought up to it? And what would
the crook be doing meanwhile? He’d still have to be
caught.”</p>

<p>“It would all help, even though we don’t get the hang of
it, or the commissioner would not be trying it on the
boys,” declared McCarty loyally. “Some of them that
have not yet been promoted to headquarters would not be
hurt by anything that would teach them to use their heads
now and then, I’m thinking!”</p>

<p>There was that in his voice which made his companion
straighten in his chair, the mild gray eyes sparkling with
eager interest.</p>

<p>“Who’s been blundering now?” he demanded. “I ought
to have known you would not be trailing around in the
storm till near ten o’clock for the sake of your health!
What is it, Mac? For the love of God, are you on another
case?”</p>

<p>“I am not!” responded McCarty with dignity. “I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
a real estate owner, as well you know, with no connection
with the police department any more, and if an exhausted
man in mortal terror or agony drops dead in his tracks
and they ship him to the morgue as an acute alcoholic
it’s nothing to me!”</p>

<p>Dennis emptied the contents of his pipe into the tray
and rose.</p>

<p>“Where do we start from?” he asked excitedly.
“Thanks be, I’ve the next twenty-four hours off duty!
Do we have a talk with his folks first or what?”</p>

<p>“First and last, we mind our own business this time!”
McCarty waved toward the chair. “Sit down again and
light up, Denny, and I’ll give you the dope on it, though
there’s little enough according to Terry Keenan and Mike
Taggart—”</p>

<p>“Terry Keenan and Mike—!” Dennis obeyed tensely.
“That’ll be down in the old precinct, then, along the
waterfront! Who was the guy and what was he running
from when he dropped?”</p>

<p>McCarty gave an account of the evening’s occurrence,
concisely yet omitting no significant detail. When he
had finished, his visitor sat silent for a moment, turning
the story over in his none too quick mind. Then he remarked:</p>

<p>“I don’t get it at all, Mac. A prosperous, middle-aged,
respectable looking fellow by what you say, with
never a scrap of paper on him to show who he was, only
that bit of a metal tag! He must have been running from
somebody! Did you look behind you?”</p>

<p>“I did not, and neither did he.” McCarty paused.
“Mind you that, Denny! I didn’t say he was trying to
get away from anybody. The way he was running and
stopping and then reeling along once more showed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
if he was not half-crazed with pain, ’twas only will power
kept him going as far as he got. When Terry and I
turned him over, the gray look of his face came from
more than his slowing heart. It was horror that stared
out of his eyes! He was conscious, too, though the end
came in less than a minute, and muttering with his last
breath.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he might have been going some place
down among the wharves at that hour, and running till
his heart burst to get there on time?” Dennis’ pipe had
gone out in his excitement and he laid it on the tray with
a tremulous hand. “Was it blackmail? Did he think
whoever was waiting would kill him if he didn’t show
up? Mac, what manner of man was he? Fine quality
clothes and cheap shoes, elegant jewelry and a gold-filled
watch that could be bought on the installment plan!
The cigar case was real pigskin, you tell me, but—what
kind of cigars was in it?”</p>

<p>“Denny, you’ve rung the bell again, even though you
don’t know it!” McCarty gazed for a moment in affectionate
but unflattering surprise at his old friend.
“The cigars were Coronas, and there’s no better nor more
costly made! For all the clothes were of grand quality,
they didn’t fit him; they’d been carefully altered but
they’d been made in the beginning for a taller and thinner
man—and they’d had good wear. Only the cheap shoes
were new, and though the links and pin were as rich-looking
as any swell would sport they were fakes, even
if I wouldn’t give Taggart the satisfaction of telling
him so! He’d too close a shave, remember, and his hands
showed no signs of hard work; don’t you make anything
at all out of it?”</p>

<p>“He could wear the clothes, though not the shoes, of another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
man—smoke his cigars, copy his jewelry, keep his
own hands soft—? No, there’s no sense to it, whatever!”
Dennis shook his head slowly. “You’ve something up
your sleeve, but what makes you figure so much on the
close shave of him? Why was that number ‘four’ on the
other side of the tag with his initials on the key-ring?
Did you look to see if the same letters was in his hat?”</p>

<p>“It had dropped down into the gutter when he fell.”
McCarty had refrained for the time being from mentioning
his errand after the missing headgear. “Did I say
that ‘N. Q. M.’ were the dead man’s initials? I fitted a
made-up name to them in joke when Taggart was so sure
about it, but it might be an address as well. You’ve
known this town as long and as well as me, Denny; did
you ever hear of the New Queen’s Mall?”</p>

<p>“That I do,” said Denny. “You mean that one block
running through from the Park to the next avenue, with
gates shutting it in at both ends, as though the families
living in the houses on the two sides of the street was too
good to mix with the rest of the world? It’s right in the
heart of the millionaires’ part of town, with the swellest
society all around, and ’twas named after some grand
place in London, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>McCarty nodded.</p>

<p>“The Queen’s Mall. The Burminsters came from there
and they owned most of the property on both sides of
this block here. The great corner mansion on the north
side nearest the Park is where they live, and they moved
heaven and earth to close in the street with gates, the
families in the other houses liking the idea fine. The newspapers
put up a holler about the street being a public
thoroughfare and the whole business being contrary to
democracy, but that little bunch of millionaires had their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
way. That was long before ever you and me came to
this country, Denny, but the inspector told me about it,
and it’s brought up even now when there’s occasion for it
at some election time or other—”</p>

<p>“Number Four, New Queen’s Mall!” Dennis interrupted
witheringly as he emptied and pocketed his cold
pipe and rose with a glance at the clock. “’Tis twenty
minutes to eleven, and you sit there giving me a history
of New York! What are we waiting for?”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">At</span> the corner the two self-appointed investigators
found a taxi and Dennis, for once taking the lead,
insisted upon engaging it. McCarty had protested loudly
against this excursion, but the recounting of the strange
event at the waterfront had aroused all the sternly-repressed
longing to be back in the game once more, and although
he was bitterly resentful of the new order of
things at headquarters since his day the fascination of
the mystery itself had gripped him with irresistible force.
Not for worlds would he have admitted it to his companion,
however, and as they rattled eastward through the
Park he grumbled:</p>

<p>“You must have taken leave of your senses entirely,
Denny, and I’m no better, letting you drag me out again
on a night like this to gawk through barred gates at a
row of rich men’s houses! I’ve one satisfaction, though;
’twas you and not me, as you’ll kindly remember, that
hired this robber taxi!”</p>

<p>Dennis grinned to himself in the darkness.</p>

<p>“You’re welcome to the ride, Mac!” Then his tone
lowered seriously. “I’ve been thinking this thing over,
and I must have been wrong on that blackmail notion;
that the fellow was on the way to pay any, I mean, if
he had only a matter of seventy dollars on him. I’m surprised
at you, though, and even at Terry and Mike Taggart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
that not one of the three of you thought to go back
across and get the hat; it could not have sailed far, in spite
of the hill there and the gutters running over. ’Tis not
like you—”</p>

<p>“Damn the hat!” McCarty interrupted irascibly. “’Tis
the man himself I’m thinking of; now if the cold, muddy
rain-water in the gutter had anything to do with it—?”</p>

<p>He mumbled and lapsed into silence and after a discreet
interval his companion observed in an aggrieved tone:</p>

<p>“Through more than muddy rain-water have I followed
you on many a case you’ve dragged me into, but if the
grand education you’ve been getting lately from those
books has made you talk in riddles, you can keep the answers
to yourself for all of me! By the same token, if
that fellow was not running away from anybody or hurrying
to meet them but was just chasing along like that
through the storm, staggering and stopping and leaping
forward again, he must have been out of his head entirely,
and the asylum would have got him if the morgue
hadn’t!”</p>

<p>“True for you, Denny; that’s what was in my mind
just now,” McCarty replied with a contrite return to his
habitual geniality. “Not about his being a lunatic,
maybe, but delirious from sickness or suffering. When
he fell, with his head hanging over the gutter and the cold
water rushing over his face I was thinking it brought
back his consciousness for that minute there at the end.
You could see by the look in his eyes and the way he
fought for breath that there was something he was trying
his best to tell, something that filled him with more horror
than the fear of death itself!”</p>

<p>“’Tis a lot to see in a man’s eye,” Dennis remarked in
unusual skepticism. “Maybe he’d no notion of dying;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
he seems to have been a pretty healthy looking fellow,
from what you tell me. If those books are getting you
to read meanings in people’s faces that are not there you’d
best be sticking to the newspapers!”</p>

<p>“’Tis small meaning anybody could read in yours, my
lad!” the indignant student retorted. “Here we are and
the gates are shut, just as I told you. What’s the next
move? You started this, Denny, and it’s up to you!”</p>

<p>But it proved to be up to neither of them, for, as McCarty
descended from the taxi before the great gates of
wrought iron which spanned the side street, a tall figure
emerged from the shadows and a well-known voice exclaimed
in accents of satisfaction not untinged with
amusement:</p>

<p>“There you are, Mac! I’ve been waiting for you.”</p>

<p>“Inspector!” McCarty gasped, gaping at his former
superior. “How in the world did you know—?”</p>

<p>Inspector Druet laughed.</p>

<p>“How did I know you’d be on the scent with the trail
fresh and the wind your way? Good evening, Riordan;
it’s like old times to find you following Mac’s lead again.”</p>

<p>“’Tis Denny that’s leading this night,” averred McCarty,
with a chuckle, as Dennis turned to pay the taxi
driver. “In spite of the rain and all, he was possessed to
come and have a look around here when I told him about
the drunk that fell dead across the street from the station-house
down by the waterfront!”</p>

<p>“The ‘drunk,’ eh?” Inspector Druet tapped a leather
case which he carried. “I have the man’s hat here which
you found in the gutter, and I needn’t ask if you saw the
initials inside, though you said nothing to the boys at
the house. When I found out you’d been on the scene,
and got a line from them on the way you’d collected all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
the dope on the case and then quietly faded away with a
pathetic reference to rheumatism, I knew you would be on
the job. Then your phone didn’t answer a little while ago
and I was morally certain you had read that identification
tag correctly and were on your way here, so I waited.
It looks as though this was going to be bigger than it appeared
at first.”</p>

<p>They had drawn under the comparative shelter of an
overhanging cornice, and Dennis, who had turned to gaze
reproachfully at McCarty when the hat was mentioned,
asked with lively interest:</p>

<p>“Do you mean, Inspector, that the fellow didn’t just
drop dead by accident? What was the initials? Who
was he?”</p>

<p>“The initials are ‘B. P.’” The inspector spoke with
added impressiveness. “I have a list of all the householders
on this block; there are only a few, for you can
see by the street-lamps that each place is several times the
size of an ordinary city lot. The owner of Number
Seven is Benjamin Parsons, and if this is his hat—?”</p>

<p>“But the tag on the key-ring said Number Four,”
Dennis observed doubtfully as the inspector paused.
“Somebody named ‘B. P.’ might live there too, sir.”</p>

<p>“Number Four is occupied by a bachelor alone, a Mr.
Henry Orbit.” The inspector shook his head. “I don’t
know how the keys of his house came to be in Parsons’
pocket, but that’s a detail. Here’s the private watchman
now; come on.”</p>

<p>He moved out toward the gateway in the middle of the
street but McCarty laid a detaining hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Just one minute, Inspector. Well I know I’ve nothing
to do with this case, if there is a case in it at all, but
’tis easier to change hats than houses, and if you stop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
by first at Number Four, and—and let me do the talking
to whoever opens the door—?”</p>

<p>He hesitated and Inspector Druet flashed him a keen
glance.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mac?” he demanded quickly. “Have you
seen more than I have in this?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen the corpse, sir,” McCarty returned evasively.</p>

<p>Along the enclosed street the solitary figure of the
private watchman was advancing with quickened step.
When he reached the gate the inspector spoke to him in a
low but authoritative tone. The watchman uttered a
startled exclamation and a brief colloquy ensued during
which McCarty and Dennis gazed up the wide vista of the
street beyond the high iron bars. In the glow of the
lanterns which lighted the Mall the smooth pavement
glistened like a sheet of glass under the dancing raindrops
and the houses on either side, built of gleaming marble
or the darker brownstone of an older period, looked like
miniature palaces, with their vaguely outlined turrets and
towers and overhanging balconies. Straight ahead loomed
another gate, behind it the inky mass of foliage of the
great park across the Avenue, untouched as yet by the
season’s first frost.</p>

<p>“’Tis like a picture-book scene, even in the night!”
Dennis remarked, and then he shook his head. “But it’s
too restricted, entirely. For all its grandeur, the folks
living in there will be having no more chance of keeping
their private affairs one from the other than if ’twas a
row of workman’s cottages out in the factory suburbs!
’Tis small mystery could last for long inside these gates!”</p>

<p>“I’d rather be outside them and free, than cooped up in
there for all the millions these families have,” acquiesced
McCarty. “The watchman’s opening up, though, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
inspector is beckoning. Will he be letting me have my
way, I wonder?”</p>

<p>The great gates swung inward and the three passed in,
the inspector leading and turning to the south sidewalk
which was bordered by the houses bearing even numbers.</p>

<p>“Of course I know the servants belonging to every
household on the block,” the gray-haired watchman was
saying in a slightly lofty tone. “Mr. Orbit has none with
the initials you mention, Inspector, and no house guests
at present or I should have been notified. It’s my business,
and the day man’s, to know everybody who comes
and goes through the gates.”</p>

<p>“You see, Mac?” Dennis nudged his companion.
“’Tis worse than a jail!”</p>

<p>But McCarty paid no heed. He was eyeing the house
fronts as they passed with a gaze of critical absorption,
giving quick glances at the occasional lighted windows of
those across the way, but the latter were all discreetly
curtained, and the first two houses on the south side were
utterly dark. The third—Number Six—was a rococo
affair of some pinkish stone, bristling with tiny pointed
turrets and unexpected balconies. Here a brilliant light
shone from the upper floors, but the next house—Number
Four—although small in contrast to the mansions
across the street, gave an impression of size in its stately
lines of snowy marble, broken only by the windows with
dark, graceful vines trailing from the boxes on each sill.</p>

<p>It appeared to be attached to the farther house by a conservatory
of some sort, but there was no time to explore
further, for the watchman had halted and Inspector Druet
mounted the steps and rang the bell. McCarty followed
with Dennis at his heels. As they paused, waiting, the
soft but deeply resonant tones of an organ came to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
ears from behind the windows to their right, from which
emanated a subdued glow of light.</p>

<p>From the far end of the street behind them a faint gong
sounded and with an exclamation of annoyance the watchman
hurried off to open the gate on the park side for the
entrance of a motor car. He had scarcely passed beyond
earshot when the inspector whispered to McCarty:</p>

<p>“What’s the idea, Mac? Did you hear what the watchman
said? ‘B. P.’ didn’t belong here, in spite of the tag
on the key-ring.”</p>

<p>“No more he did, sir,” McCarty agreed, but there was
no disappointment in his tone. “I just want a word with
the one that opens the door.”</p>

<p>There was no sound of footsteps from within but as
McCarty finished speaking the door opened. Silhouetted
against the soft light was the figure of a man, before
whom, for the moment, even McCarty’s ready tongue was
silenced. Dennis choked. They were confronted by a
man who, though taller than the average of his race, was
unmistakably Mongolian and clad in the flowing robes of
his native land. He bowed slightly but in a dignified
fashion, and then, as the visitors still remained silent,
he asked:</p>

<p>“What is it you desire, please?”</p>

<p>His voice was high and singsong but it bore no trace of
an accent.</p>

<p>“We don’t want to disturb Mr. Orbit, if there’s been a
mistake made, but a man who says he’s a servant here
has met with a bit of an accident,” McCarty explained.
“He’s kind of stout with a round, red face and a little
bald spot on his head. Forty-five or nearer fifty years
old, he might be. Can you tell us his name?”</p>

<p>He had edged closer to the side of the wide entrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
door, so that, in continuing to face him, the Chinaman
had been compelled to turn until the low light played
across his countenance but it remained gravely inscrutable
as he listened. And although there was a perceptible
pause, when he did reply, the words followed each other
without hesitation.</p>

<p>“It is Hughes, the valet. You desire to talk with Mr.
Orbit? He is engaged but I will see if he can receive
you. This way, sirs.”</p>

<p>He closed the door after them and led the way into the
house. As he walked the long queue which depended
from his head almost to his knees swayed with each step.</p>

<p>“A Chink!” Dennis whispered. “What is he, the laundress
here?”</p>

<p>Once again his remark went unheeded for McCarty was
staring about him. He had seen many wealthy homes in
the past, but never had he entered an apartment of such
unostentatious magnificence as this hall of Mr. Henry
Orbit’s house. He could not know that he walked among
almost priceless treasures, that the dim panels on the walls
were Catalan tapestries of the fifteenth century, that the
frescoed ceiling had known the brush of Raphael himself,
and that upon the great carved chair, secretly removed
from the Duomo long ago, had once rested the exhausted
but dauntless frame of Savonarola. The ex-roundsman
could only feel with some sixth sense, that he was in the
presence of beauty and he trod as lightly as his clumping
boots would permit on the ancient, deep-piled rug beneath
his feet.</p>

<p>The Chinese butler conducted them to a spacious room
at the left of the hall, bowed them to chairs and withdrew,
closing the door behind him. From the room opposite
the swelling notes of the organ rose, filling their ears with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
a thunder of harmony which made the impressionable
Dennis catch his breath and instinctively bow his head.</p>

<p>“Come out of it, Denny! We’re not in church!” McCarty
admonished, and then turned to the inspector.
“You see, sir, that fellow who died down there by the
wharves was wearing his own cheap shoes but the expensive
hand-me-down clothes of another man not his
own build, and who would that have been but his employer?
He’d shaved too often and very close like a man
who was constantly in service, a butler or a valet, and if
he borrowed, without leave, cigars too good for the likes
of his taste he might have borrowed a hat, without leave
as well. It struck me the keys was his own, though,
along with the little metal tag and that’s why I thought
maybe we’d save time by stopping here first.”</p>

<p>“You were right, again!” Inspector Druet exclaimed
heartily. “I was in such a hurry that I took too much for
granted. We’ll see what Mr. Orbit can tell us about this
man of his.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Orbit did not immediately appear, and as the
last notes of the organ throbbed into silence, Dennis found
his voice.</p>

<p>“Valet or no, what was any one from a grand house
like this doing down in that tough precinct by the waterfront,
and in all the storm? Answer me that! What did
he die of, did the ambulance doctor know?”</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t up to him to say; he just pronounced the
man dead and now it’s the medical examiner’s job, but
we’ll know in the morning, after the autopsy.... What
have you found over there, Mac, anything interesting?”</p>

<p>The room into which the Chinese had ushered them was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
a library, modern and luxurious yet monastic in tone, with
tall-backed, cathedral chairs, refectory tables and benches
and dried rushes covering the inlaid marble floor. A
single huge log smoldered upon the hearth and books
lined the wall space from floor to ceiling between the narrow,
stained-glass windows. The light came from
torches held in sconces and braziers suspended from massive
chains.</p>

<p>McCarty had strolled over to a low row of open shelves
where he stood with his back to his two companions. He
seemed not to have heard the inspector’s query.</p>

<p>“It’s literature he’s took up now,” Dennis explained
gloomily, “all along of that new school the commissioner’s
opening at headquarters. This psycho-whatzis has gone
to the head of him, and I misdoubt Mac’ll ever be the
same man again!”</p>

<p>McCarty’s expression denoted symptoms of apoplexy
at this slanderous betrayal, but before he turned he surreptitiously
slipped into his inner breast pocket a pamphlet
bound in pale blue paper which had fallen almost into his
hands when he removed a larger, leather-covered volume.
He replaced the latter and turned with dignity to approach
the hearth once more.</p>

<p>“You’ll need to lose no sleep over me, Denny, and
there’s more than me would not be hurting themselves
by improving their minds!” he announced cuttingly.
“The inspector’s here on a case of—of sudden death, not
to listen to your opinion of my private affairs!”</p>

<p>There was an amused but affectionate softening of the
inspector’s keen eyes as they glanced at his erstwhile subordinate.
He opened his lips to speak when a pleasantly
modulated voice from the doorway behind them fell upon
their ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“What can I do for you, gentlemen?” it said. “I am
Mr. Orbit.”</p>

<p>The three visitors turned to find a tall, slenderly erect
man in dinner clothes regarding them with gravely inquiring
eyes. He must have been well over fifty, but the
lines in his strikingly distinguished face were those of
strength, not age, his dark hair was only lightly powdered
with gray at the temples and he bore himself with the air
of a man at the apex of his prime.</p>

<p>As he advanced into the room the inspector stepped
forward to meet him.</p>

<p>“Sorry to have disturbed you, Mr. Orbit, but we will
only detain you for a few minutes. I am Inspector Druet
from Police Headquarters and these are two of my assistants.
We want a little information about a certain
man who carries a tag with this house address on his key-ring.”</p>

<p>Henry Orbit nodded slowly and the concern deepened
upon his face as he waved them back to their chairs and
seated himself in a highbacked one facing them.</p>

<p>“I know of no one who carries such a tag except my
valet, Hughes. Is he in any trouble? Ching Lee tells me
that, from your description, the man about whom you are
inquiring is undoubtedly Hughes.”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem surprised,” the inspector observed
bluntly. “Has this valet of yours been in trouble before?”</p>

<p>A shadow of regret more than annoyance crossed the
face of their host and he shook his head.</p>

<p>“He has gotten into more than one scrape, although
nothing, to my knowledge, of course, that would engage
the attention of the police. I am afraid he is rather a
scoundrel, but he has been with me for twenty-two years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
and I cannot believe him utterly reprehensible. Has he
suggested to you that I would help him now?”</p>

<p>“The man I’m asking about is beyond any one’s help,”
responded the official. “He is dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead!” the other repeated in a low, shocked tone,
after a moment’s pause. “It seems incredible! Only a
few hours ago I gave him permission to go out! What
happened? Did some accident occur?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we want to find out,” Inspector Druet
announced grimly. “There are several suspicious circumstances
connected with his death. Do you know of
any enemies he may have had?”</p>

<p>Orbit frowned slightly and his glance traveled in
startled amazement to the faces of McCarty and Dennis
and back again to his interrogator.</p>

<p>“‘Enemies?’” he repeated. “Surely there was no
violence? I know nothing of Hughes’ personal affairs
but I should not have fancied he had an active enemy in
the world!”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE NOSE OF DENNIS RIORDAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> was a second pause and then the inspector
asked: “Did he give you any excuse for wanting an
evening out to-night?”</p>

<p>“No, none. It was not unusual and I thought nothing
of it.” Orbit’s hands clenched slightly. “I cannot believe
that poor Hughes is really gone! Perhaps Ching
Lee made a mistake, perhaps some one else had come into
possession of Hughes’ key-ring. Will you describe him
to me, please, and tell me the suspicious circumstances
you mentioned?”</p>

<p>“You describe the fellow, Mac; you examined him and
his clothes more closely than I did.” There was a double
significance in the inspector’s tone and he added:
“Special Deputy McCarty happened to be there when this
man died.”</p>

<p>Orbit nodded and fixed his eyes expectantly on McCarty
as the latter briefly complied with the inspector’s
request, without, however, mentioning the letters in the
hat. When he had finished, Orbit exclaimed:</p>

<p>“It is he, beyond a doubt! The raincoat and brown
sack suit were my own, given to him when I tired of them
myself, and he must have copied my cat’s-eye pin and
links, although I never saw them. How did he die?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, he was hurrying along in the rain and all of
a sudden he dropped.” McCarty chose his words carefully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
“When me and a friend of mine got to him he was
breathing his last and the end came as I lifted his head to
my knee.... How did he happen to be wearing a hat
with the letters ‘B. P.’ in it, Mr. Orbit? Who is B. P.?”</p>

<p>Orbit frowned again thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I cannot at the moment recall any one with those
initials but naturally I have no knowledge of his friends or
associates,” he replied at last. “Surely that is immaterial,
however. What was suspicious about the poor fellow’s
death? He was an irreproachable servant but when his
time was his own his habits were irregular and I should
not have been surprised to learn that his heart had failed
or he had suffered a stroke.”</p>

<p>“Had he been drinking the last time you saw him; this
evening, I think you said?” McCarty asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly not! I have never seen him under the influence
of alcohol or he would not have remained an hour
in my service. He was fully aware of this, and although
I am convinced that he occasionally drank to excess he was
careful never to let me see him in such a condition. Had
he been drinking when you went to his assistance?”</p>

<p>McCarty ignored the question.</p>

<p>“You don’t ask where that was, I notice. Have you
any notion where he could have been going to-night?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest,” Orbit shrugged. “I have told you
that I am quite ignorant of his private affairs and have
had no interest in them.”</p>

<p>“Still, he’d been your personal servant for a matter of
twenty-odd years,” McCarty insisted. “Wouldn’t you
want to know what he was up to if you learned he’d left
your house to go down along the waterfront, in one of the
toughest districts in the city?”</p>

<p>Orbit stared in genuine amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“‘The waterfront?’” he repeated. “I cannot imagine
what he could have been doing in such a district as you
describe! Even in his dissipations Hughes was never
attracted by anything sordid, to my knowledge, but aped
even the vices of men of a higher station than he.”</p>

<p>“I was coming to that,” McCarty remarked. “You
spoke awhile back of trouble he’d got into more than once;
what sort of trouble?”</p>

<p>“Gambling debts and indiscreet affairs with women;
upper servants like himself or the wives of upper servants.
When monetary settlements were in order he came to me
for an advance on his salary and that is how I learned of
his difficulties.” Orbit paused and then added reflectively:
“He has been in none of late, however; at least,
none which required assistance from me.”</p>

<p>“About what hour to-night was the last time you saw
him alive?”</p>

<p>“At a little before seven, when he laid out these clothes
for me.” Orbit motioned to his attire. “Some guests
were dining with me—three gentlemen, all near neighbors—and
I was preoccupied but Hughes’ appearance and
manner must have been quite as usual or I would have
noted a change. My guests are still here.”</p>

<p>He paused significantly and McCarty replied directly
to the hint.</p>

<p>“We’re sorry to keep you from them but we’ve got to
know what your man was doing down in that neighborhood.
You don’t know his own friends maybe, but you
might know which of the servants employed by your
neighbors he’s been most friendly with, and if you don’t
maybe your neighbors themselves would know.”</p>

<p>“Really, is it as important as that?” There was still no
trace of annoyance in Orbit’s voice or manner but merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
a dignified protest. “You can understand that any
notoriety in connection with the death of my unfortunate
valet would be highly distasteful to me, and to have my
friends subjected to it would be doubly so. My guests
this evening are Mr. Gardner Sloane and his son, Mr.
Brinsley Sloane, Second, who live across the street at
Number Five, and Mr. Eustace Goddard, from Number
Two, the corner house next door to me here. I have no
idea whether or not Hughes was even acquainted with
any of the servants in either the Sloane or Goddard households,
but I will inquire.”</p>

<p>He rose and left the room, and the inspector turned to
McCarty.</p>

<p>“Is all this necessary, Mac? I know I said this looked
big but that was when I thought the man dead down there
near the river was the millionaire Parsons. If it’s just a
dissipated valet we can let it slide, at least unless the
autopsy discloses foul play of some sort.”</p>

<p>“When you asked me if I’d seen more in this than you,
inspector, I told you I’d seen the corpse,” McCarty reminded
him quietly. “Now you’re asking me if it’s
necessary to find out even before the autopsy who this
fellow Hughes was friendly with and I’ll say it won’t do
any harm, because I saw him before he was a corpse!
Heart disease he may have died of, or apoplexy, but it
may be a good thing for us to know what brought it on
him so sudden to-night, even if he was just a valet!”</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the earnestness in his tones
and the inspector started to speak, but once more he was
forestalled by the opening of the door, and Orbit ushered
in three men. The first was slightly younger than his
host, stout and bald except for a fringe of sandy hair.
His mouth beneath the small, reddish mustache had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
humorous quirk at the corners which appeared to be
habitual, his blue eyes twinkled and he regarded the police
official and his two deputies with a frank and not unfriendly
curiosity.</p>

<p>The second man was approximately the same age but
his smooth-shaven face was strikingly handsome and his
youthfully cut dinner coat was worn with a jauntiness
which proclaimed the middle-aged gallant.</p>

<p>The last of Mr. Orbit’s guests to enter was a tall, thin
man of about thirty, whose inordinately serious expression
was enhanced by the shell-rimmed glasses which bestrode
the bridge of his nose. His chin was cleft, like that
of the man who had immediately preceded him and there
was an unmistakable family resemblance between them.
Even before the introduction McCarty placed him as
Brinsley Sloane, Second, the older man as his father,
Gardner Sloane, and the first to enter, therefore, as the
next-door neighbor, Eustace Goddard.</p>

<p>It was Goddard who spoke first.</p>

<p>“Too bad about poor Hughes, inspector. Very hard
on Mr. Orbit, I must say. I’ve seen Hughes about the
house here for years, of course, but I don’t think I’ve
exchanged half a dozen words with him in my life and
I’m quite sure none of the servants in my household know
anything more about him than I do.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Goddard?” asked the inspector.</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing, they’re all elderly and staid—been
with my family for years. Mr. Orbit happened to mention
the fact just now that Hughes was given to dissipation
occasionally. He wouldn’t have found anything in
common with our staff, but you are welcome to question
them to-morrow as much as you please.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.” The inspector turned to the elder of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
two remaining guests. “Mr. Sloane, have you happened
to notice any acquaintanceship between Mr. Orbit’s valet
and your servants?”</p>

<p>There was a slight touch of sarcasm in his voice and the
flush which mounted to Goddard’s scant red hair showed
that the shot had gone home. Gardner Sloane responded
with a hearty assumption of cordiality:</p>

<p>“Can’t say that I have, inspector. We are a household
of men, for my son and I are alone with my father, who
is very old and an invalid. His male nurse, a Swede who
speaks little English, and John Platt the butler who is
nearly seventy, are the only servants in our employ with
whom there is any likelihood that Hughes might have
come in contact. However, I have observed him on several
occasions in the company of a butler in service in
another house on this block and although I find it very
distasteful to direct even the most casual of official inquiries
to an establishment presided over by an unprotected
lady—”</p>

<p>“Father!” the young man interrupted in precise,
shocked tones. “I am astonished—!”</p>

<p>“You usually are, Brin,” interrupted the elder in his
turn. “It is my duty to tell these officers what I have
seen. The only servant here in the Mall I have ever
noticed in Hughes’ company is Snape, Mrs. Bellamy’s
butler; if any of them knows anything about the fellow’s
private affairs, it should be he.”</p>

<p>“Which is Mrs. Bellamy’s house?” the inspector inquired.</p>

<p>“Number Six, next door to this on the east,” the
younger Sloane replied hastily. “I am sure, however,
that my father must be mistaken, and if you annoy Mrs.
Bellamy at such an hour as this merely for below-stairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
gossip, you will distress her greatly. Indeed, why should
any of us be interrogated? The man Hughes dropped
dead in the street, I understand; it means nothing to any
one except Mr. Orbit, who has lost an efficient servant!”</p>

<p>Again the inspector sent a hurried glance at McCarty,
who ignored the indignant young man and turned to the
master of the house.</p>

<p>“Mr. Orbit, have you any notion what relations Hughes
had?”</p>

<p>“None, in this country. He was the son of a blacksmith
in Cornwall who went to London when a lad and
took service as a bootboy. From this he rose to the position
of valet and when he came to me he was, as Mr.
Sloane has observed, a most efficient one.”</p>

<p>“Then,” McCarty spoke musingly, as though to himself,
“there’ll be no one to notify about the funeral arrangements.”</p>

<p>“I shall assume all responsibility, of course,” Orbit announced.
“I will arrange with an undertaking establishment
to send for the body at once. It has been removed
to the morgue?”</p>

<p>McCarty nodded.</p>

<p>“To-morrow’ll do, sir; there’ll have to be some formalities,
permits and such. The inspector will let you
know.”</p>

<p>McCarty and his companions had remained standing
since the re-entrance of Orbit with his guests and now he
signaled with lifted eyebrows to his former superior and
nodded almost imperceptibly toward the door. Inspector
Druet nodded in response and turned to the four men collectively.</p>

<p>“We won’t trouble you any further, and if we can
obtain the information we want elsewhere it will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
be necessary to question the servants of any one living
here in the Mall. Goodnight.”</p>

<p>The Chinese butler was waiting to show them out but
McCarty lingered for a moment after the others had preceded
him.</p>

<p>“You’re the butler here?”</p>

<p>The other bowed in silent affirmation and McCarty went
on:</p>

<p>“How many other servants are employed here and what
are their names?”</p>

<p>“André the chef, Jean the houseman and little Fu Moy
the coffee boy. That is all except Hughes.” The reply
came without a pause in the falsetto singsong monotone.</p>

<p>“Hughes is dead,” McCarty said abruptly.</p>

<p>Again the Chinese bowed and when he raised his head
his expression had not changed an iota.</p>

<p>After vainly waiting for some remark in response, McCarty
asked:</p>

<p>“You were all in to-night? Did any one leave this
house since afternoon except Hughes?”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>There was a suggestion of finality in the oddly chanting
tones now and the discomfited questioner shrugged and
rejoined the inspector and Dennis who were waiting on
the sidewalk before the many-turreted house next door.
All the lights had been extinguished except one on the top
floor which gleamed down upon them like a single wakeful
eye.</p>

<p>“What were you getting out of that Chink?” Dennis demanded
as they started toward the eastern gate where the
watchman waited.</p>

<p>“Not a living thing that I wanted except a list of the
other servants of the household and word that none of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
them but Hughes had left the doors this night,” McCarty
responded disgustedly. “What he got out of me was my
goat! I sprung it on him quick that Hughes had croaked
and he never turned a hair nor uttered a word but just
waited politely for me to go along about my business!”</p>

<p>“It is conceivable that Orbit told him when he went to
bring his guests,” the inspector observed dryly.</p>

<p>“Did he strike you as being the sort that would stop
then to talk to one of the servants? He didn’t me,” McCarty
averred. “He may tell this Ching Lee, as he
called him, after his three neighbors go, but it’ll be only
so that he can break the news to the others before the
morning papers come out. Twenty-two years this Hughes
has been with him and Orbit knew no more about his affairs
than the day he hired him! ’Tis unnatural that
never once in all that time did they talk together as man
to man and yet I don’t think Orbit lied, at that. Look at
the way he treated us! He was polite and friendly
enough and never once could you have laid your finger on
a word or a look from him that was haughty or arrogant
like the most of them act over here when the police get
snooping around, and yet didn’t you kind of feel as though
you were talking to a Royal Duke at the least? It’s the
grand manner of him, that he don’t even know he’s got.”</p>

<p>“A fine gentleman, Mr. Orbit,” Dennis agreed. “We’ve
found out nothing, though, about what Hughes was doing
down in Mike Taggart’s precinct nor why he ran like
that till he dropped, and likely we’ll not find it here between
these two gates.”</p>

<p>“There’s something more than that on your mind,
Mac!” the inspector declared shrewdly. “You’d never
have insisted on questioning Orbit’s friends if you hadn’t
some idea of what caused Hughes’ seizure, and that it led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
back here! What did you see before he died that you’re
keeping to yourself?”</p>

<p>“Tell you to-morrow, inspector, if you’ll drop in when
you’ve nothing better to do, or ’phone Denny and me the
word to come downtown to you,” replied McCarty hurriedly
in a lowered tone for they had almost reached the
gate and the watchman was advancing to meet them.
“Denny’s off duty and I’m taking him home with me the
night, though I misdoubt he’ll keep me up till dawn with
his wild theories as to what desperate crime took Hughes
down to the waterfront! Thanks be, the rain has stopped
and he’ll not be wanting to ride home in state!”</p>

<p>But it was McCarty himself who hailed a prowling taxi
when they had taken leave of the inspector and discreetly
rounded a corner, and he had no time on the homeward
way to glance at the meter, being engaged in mollifying
his outraged companion.</p>

<p>“Will you never learn, you simpleton, when I’m talking
about you for the benefit of somebody else?” he demanded
in exasperation, when Dennis with bitter resentment had
spurned his hospitality. “’Twas to put off the inspector
I dropped that hint about being wishful for my sleep or
he would have trailed along with us to find out what I’d
got up my sleeve, and well you know ’tis nothing but the
expression on a dying man’s face and the way he tried to
speak but couldn’t! He’ll have the laugh on the both of
us to-morrow if the medical examiner says ’twas ‘natural
causes,’ and he’ll forget all about this night’s doings, but
I won’t; I’m going to find out why Hughes ran the breath
from his body and what it was he tried so hard to say.”</p>

<p>“Some day,” Dennis began darkly, but with a tell-tale
softening in his tones, “some day you’ll broadcast through
me once too often and this radio station will shut down on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
you! The inspector was right, though; I can see that
now. Whatever made Hughes throw that fit, you think
it happened back in that society fire line or you’d not have
listened to the fat, bald little man, nor yet the old he-gossip
and his son. I misdoubt but some night we’ll be putting
a scaling ladder against that iron fence and chloroforming
the watchman, so you can put that butler next
door through the third degree!”</p>

<p>Back in McCarty’s rooms once more Dennis dried his
rain-soaked boots comfortably before the little coal fire in
the grate and watched with a quizzical light in his eyes
while his host stowed his newly acquired library carefully
away in a closet and then proceeded to clear out the accumulated
litter of several days’ bachelor housekeeping,
but he said no word until the task was accomplished.
Then he observed:</p>

<p>“When you’re working on a case, Mac, you use your
head, and the eyes and ears of you, but to-night another of
your senses was asleep at the switch. Not that it had
anything to do with Hughes, of course, but no more did
anything else we learned except his name! You overlooked
one little bet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I did, did I!” McCarty retorted, stung but wary.
“And what sense of mine was it that was not working?”</p>

<p>“Smell.” The reply was succinct. “Unless you’re
holding out on me, your nose was not on the job.”</p>

<p>McCarty stared.</p>

<p>“What was there to smell?” he demanded. “Since
when is your nose keener than mine?”</p>

<p>“’Tis keen for one thing it’s been trained to for many
a year, and that’s fire. Mac, there’s been a fire in Orbit’s
house, and not more than a few hours before we got
there!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“A fire, is it!” McCarty snorted. “There’d likely been
one in the kitchen, since dinner was cooked there, and you
saw the log burning on the hearth in the library—!”</p>

<p>“Stoves and hearths don’t burn wool and silk and carpets
and varnished wood, my lad!” Dennis laid his pipe
on the mantel and rose. “It could only have been a small
bit of a fire, for the smoke of it had cleared away entirely,
but the smell hadn’t; there was enough of that hanging
in the air for me to get the whiff, anyway, even though
nobody else could. I’ve not the gift to explain it right,
but there’s a different smell to everything that’s inflammable,
if you’ve the nose for it, and it was house furnishings
had been burned this night!”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE INSPECTOR BRINGS NEWS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> twain slept late the next morning, and they had
only just returned from the little restaurant around
the corner, where McCarty habitually took his meals,
when the bell jangled on its loose wire from below.</p>

<p>“Don’t disturb yourself, Mac,” Dennis admonished
with a grin, as his host threw down his newspaper. “I’ll
let the inspector in.”</p>

<p>“And why are you so sure—!”</p>

<p>“’Twas not in my honor you cleaned house last night,
but because you knew the inspector would be here, and
you did it then for you were sure he’d come so early
there’d be no time this morning.” Dennis emitted one of
his rare chuckles as he pressed the button which released
the lock on the entrance door. “Since I’ve been associating
so much with detectives, active and retired, I’m getting
to work their way, myself!”</p>

<p>“It’s too clever you’re growing, by half!” McCarty
grumbled, but there was a twinkle in his eye as he strode
past the other and opening the door, leaned over the banisters.
In a passable imitation of the inspector’s own
amusedly satisfied tones of the night before he called
down: “There you are, sir! We’ve been waiting for
you.”</p>

<p>“The devil you have!” Inspector Druet laughed as he
bounded up the stairs with a lightness which belied his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
gray hair. “Getting back at me for last night, eh? If
you hadn’t held out on me we’d have been on the job still
in the New Queen’s Mall!—’Morning, Riordan! I suppose
you’re crowing over me, too!”</p>

<p>“There’ll not be a peep out of me, let alone a crow, till
I know what’s doing, inspector, for Mac’s told me nothing
except the look he saw on Hughes’ face,” Dennis replied,
as he drew forward the shabby easy-chair and placed an
ash-tray within reach. His homely, long face was set in
lines of deep seriousness once more and the inspector’s,
too, had sobered.</p>

<p>McCarty closed the door and taking a box of cigars
from the mantel he held it out to the visitor.</p>

<p>“The autopsy’ll be over, I’m thinking.” He spoke
carelessly enough but his breath labored with suppressed
excitement. “What kind of poison was it, inspector?”</p>

<p>The inspector nodded slowly.</p>

<p>“I <em>thought</em> you had guessed! It was physostigmine,
the medical examiner called it; powdered Calabar bean.
It’s colorless, has no taste, and a single grain would be
fatal in three hours or a little longer, but Hughes had
taken a trifle more than a grain.”</p>

<p>“Holy saints!” gasped Dennis. “So ’twas murder,
after all!”</p>

<p>An expression of honest gratification had stolen over
McCarty’s face but he shook his head.</p>

<p>“Many kinds of beans I have heard of, including
the Mexican ones that jump like a frog, but never the
sort that bring death,” he said. “If one grain of it would
kill in three or four hours, a little more would kill in
two or maybe three, I suppose. It was around nine
o’clock when Hughes fell there across from the station-house,
so he must have taken that powdered bean before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
he left the Orbit house or right after, though we’ve not
yet fixed the time he did leave. I wonder what would
be the symptoms of that poison?”</p>

<p>“I asked the medical examiner,” the inspector responded.
“Pain in the abdomen, nausea, then spasmodic
respiration, numbness, and a complete paralysis of respiration,
which of course would mean death. It doesn’t
explain his staggering along so that Terry thought he
was drunk—”</p>

<p>He paused and McCarty lighted his own cigar and
drew contemplatively upon it before he spoke.</p>

<p>“Maybe it would. The pain had passed and the nausea,
but it had left him weak and the paralysis was creeping
over the lungs of him so that he was fighting like mad
for breath, reeling and stopping and lurching forward
again. He was choking and gasping when Terry and me
first turned him over and he died with a heave and a
snort as if a ton weight had landed on the chest of him.
It was agony that I saw in his face and the horror of
knowing he’d been poisoned; he knew who did it, too,
or I miss my guess, for ’twas that he was trying to tell
when the end came!”</p>

<p>“What else did you see?” The inspector’s tone held an
unwonted note of asperity. “I want to know everything
that happened, Mac, from the first minute you laid eyes
on the fellow! If you had told me last night before the
watchman opened the gates we might have saved precious
time!”</p>

<p>“I’d nothing to tell but the look on Hughes’ face and
him trying so hard to speak, and that I thought maybe
he’d been running like that because he was delirious from
pain and not in liquor. There was no mark on him when
we carried him into the station-house, at least none that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
showed, and it come to me it must be poison. But with
nothing more to go on than just my own private suspicions,
I didn’t want to air them unless the autopsy proved
there was grounds for them. I’ll be reminding you, inspector,
that I’ve resigned from the Force long since and
the new methods—”</p>

<p>“New methods be damned!” exploded the inspector.
“You’ve said that about every case we’ve worked out
together since you did resign, but you’ve come back long
enough each time to find out the truth when no one else
could. I told Orbit last night that you were a special
deputy of mine, and by the Lord you are from now on,
till we’ve found out who killed Hughes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” McCarty said meekly, avoiding Dennis’ eye,
but the latter had an immediate difficulty of his own on
his mind.</p>

<p>“If Hughes took that poison, or ’twas give to him,
either before or just after he left the house, ’twill be on
that block between those two locked gates that Mac will
be looking first for clues, and they’re guarded night and
day; you heard what that watchman said,” he remarked
wistfully. “You’ll be getting a pass for Mac, likely, but
unless a fire starts inside big enough for a general alarm
there’ll be no chance of me following him, inspector, and
’twill be the first case ever he tackled since he left the
Force that I didn’t get in on with him from start to
finish, every minute I was off duty.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Riordan,” Inspector Druet smiled.
“I’ve never been able to figure out which of you two has
the luck, but your teamwork can’t be beaten and I’ll see
that you get a pass along with Mac. I’ve had a diagram
of the New Queen’s Mall prepared and brought this
copy with me for you two so you may know without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
loss of time who owns each house and which ones are
occupied.”</p>

<p>He produced a folded paper on which the street had
been roughly mapped out, with spaces, in which names
and numbers had been written, blocked off from it on
either side. The two bent their heads over it eagerly.</p>

<p>“You see there, Denny?” McCarty pointed with his
forefinger. “Looking from the Avenue, the opposite gate
to that we went into last night, the corner house, Number
Two, on the south side belongs to the Goddards. That’ll
be the stout, bald fellow with the little red mustache and
the twinkle in his eye, you mind him? Next to it, but
separated by that bulge that looks like a conservatory, is
Number Four, Orbit’s house; then comes Mrs. Bellamy’s,
Number Six, where that butler Snape works and
after that, Eight and Ten, but they’re marked ‘closed.’”</p>

<p>“The Falkinghams, Number Eight, have lived abroad
for more than twenty years and the sole heiress to Number
Ten is Georgianna Davenant, a little girl of twelve
away at school,” the inspector interposed. “That finishes
the Mall on the south side, but starting at the western
end again, a great house taking up the entire space opposite
both Goddard’s and Orbit’s and bearing two numbers,
‘one’ and ‘three’ is occupied by the Burminster
family, who originally owned most of the block and were
the moving spirits in having it enclosed with gates. Number
Five is the Sloanes’; you met two of the three
generations last night—”</p>

<p>“That’ll be the handsome, middle-aged flirt and the
son who cut him out with Mrs. Bellamy,” McCarty observed.</p>

<p>“How in the world—?” Dennis’ lantern jaw hung relaxed
and the inspector glanced up quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“’Twas as plain as the nose on your face!” McCarty
exclaimed impatiently. “Let’s go on: Number Seven,
next to the Sloanes’, is the Parsons’. That’s where this
Benjamin Parsons lives, who you thought owned the hat
Hughes was wearing, isn’t it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That hat is still a factor in the case, don’t
forget that!” The inspector bent again over the diagram
and indicated the final space. “This house, the end of the
Mall on the north, belongs to the Quentin family, and
two branches of it are fighting over the property; it’s been
unoccupied and in litigation for some years. I’m going to
call at Mrs. Bellamy’s now and interview her butler; want
to come along?”</p>

<p>Dennis rose precipitately and stretched a long arm to
the mantel for his hat, but McCarty said with quick
decision:</p>

<p>“We’ll go through the gates with you, sir, so that you
can square us with the day watchman, but I think we’d
best prowl around for awhile and not interfere with
you. We might drop in at the Orbit house later to see
if any of the other servants can talk a bit more than
Ching Lee.”</p>

<p>“If you do, be sure not to mention the autopsy, nor
the fact that it is even suspected Hughes’ death wasn’t a
natural one,” warned the inspector as they passed out to
the stairs. “I’ll probably meet you there later.”</p>

<p>They entered the Mall by way of the western gate this
time and the private watchman on duty now proved to be
younger and less obviously impressed by the dignity of his
office than the one encountered the night before. He had
evidently been apprised of their possible coming and
readily assented to the inspector’s demand that his two
deputies be admitted in future without question. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
the official himself had proceeded to the Bellamy house
McCarty turned with an affable smile to the watchman
and tendered a cigar.</p>

<p>“Have a smoke?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I’ll have to keep it till later.” He was
a tall, muscular young giant with a good-natured, not
too intelligent countenance and he grinned in an embarrassed
fashion at the overture. Then the grin faded
and he added in low tones: “They haven’t brought Alfred
Hughes’ body back yet; I’ve been watching for it all
morning.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t going to be brought here; didn’t you
know?” McCarty’s own tones were invitingly confidential.
“Mr. Orbit told Denny and me last night that
he was arranging to have it taken to some undertaking
establishment and buried from there. Didn’t he,
Denny?”</p>

<p>Not yet sure of his ground, Dennis contributed merely
a nod of affirmation to the conversation and after a disgusted
look at him McCarty asked:</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Bill—I mean ‘William’ Jennings.” The watchman
replied promptly.</p>

<p>“Well, Bill, you’ve got a pretty soft job here, haven’t
you? If you’re going to patrol your beat to the other
gate Denny and me will stroll along with you. That’s all
you have to do, isn’t it, except to give the eye to the
pretty nurse-girls of all the kids on the block?”</p>

<p>Bill Jennings reddened sheepishly.</p>

<p>“The better the neighborhood the less kids there are
in it, did you ever notice that?” he countered. “In all
six of the families living on this block there are only
three children: the Goddards’ boy, Horace, who is fourteen;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Daphne Burminster, two years younger—she
belongs in that great corner house over there but they
haven’t come back yet from the country—and little
Maudie Bellamy. Horace is kind of sickly and has a
private teacher—they call him a ‘tutor’—and Miss Daphne
has a maid and a governess, both of them old and sour.
The Bellamy baby has the only nurse on the block and
she’s foreign—French, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Some of those French girls are beauties.” McCarty
spoke with the air of a connoisseur and Dennis coughed.
The former added hastily: “Is this one a looker?”</p>

<p>“Pretty as a picture and as nice as she’s pretty!” There
was immense respect as well as admiration in Bill’s voice.
“I guess she ain’t been over long, for she’s awful young
and shy but she knows how to take care of herself, as
Alfred Hughes found out.”</p>

<p>He checked himself suddenly but McCarty chuckled
with careless amusement.</p>

<p>“He was a great hand with the women, they tell me!”
he commented.</p>

<p>“Not her kind! Lucette—even her name’s pretty, ain’t
it?—Lucette is polite to everybody but Alfred Hughes
didn’t understand that and thought he’d made a hit, I
guess. One night real late about a month ago—Dave
Hollis, the night watchman told me about it—Lucette
ran out to the drugstore for some medicine for little
Maudie, who’d been took sick awful sudden, and when
she came back Alfred Hughes met her right in front
of her own house. He must have tried to put his arm
around her or something for she gave a little cry and
Dave, who’d waited to fasten the gate again after letting
her in, came hurrying up just as Alfred Hughes said
something in a low kind of a voice and she slapped his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
face! Then she ran into the house sobbing to herself
and Dave says he gave Alfred Hughes hell—the big stiff!”
Bill checked himself again and added in renewed embarrassment.
“I didn’t mean to speak ill of the dead,
but I guess nobody on the block had much use for him,
except Mrs. Bellamy’s butler, Snape; the two of them
have been thick as thieves for years.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” McCarty turned deliberately to his self-effacing
colleague. “Didn’t somebody say as much to
you, Denny?”</p>

<p>“That Hughes and this Snape were friendly? Sure!”
Emboldened by having found his voice Dennis added
guilelessly: “’Twas that Chink butler at Orbit’s told me,
I’m thinking. Nice, sociable fellow, if he does wear a
pigtail; didn’t you find him so, Mac?”</p>

<p>“I found he’d more brains than most of the galoots who
come over here and land in the fire department!” McCarty
retorted with withering emphasis, then turned to
the watchman again. “What sort of a guy is this Snape—the
same kind as Hughes?”</p>

<p>“Underneath, maybe, but you’d never think it to look
at him. He’s younger by ten years at least than Hughes,
slim and dark and minds his own business. If it wasn’t
for the gates you’d never know when he went in or
out.”</p>

<p>McCarty darted a quick, sidelong glance at his informant.</p>

<p>“Keeps funny hours, does he?”</p>

<p>“Late ones.” Bill grinned again. “I guess Mrs. Bellamy
doesn’t know it, but being the only man in her house
he has it all his own way. He ain’t any too anxious to
have his doings known, though, for Dave says he’s tried
more than once to slip in with the milk! I ain’t spoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
ten words to him and I’ve held down this job over a
year. Here comes Horace Goddard now!”</p>

<p>The trio had strolled past the closed houses which
flanked that of Mrs. Bellamy and were nearing the eastern
gate. As Bill hurried forward, McCarty glanced through
the high iron bars of the fence and saw a slender, undersized
boy, with very red hair and a pale, delicate face, who
approached with a droop of his narrow shoulders and
a dragging step. At sight of Bill Jennings opening the
gate, however, he quickened his pace, a smile lifting the
corners of the sensitive mouth.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bill!” His voice was still a clear, almost
childish treble.</p>

<p>“Hello, there, buddy! What’s the good word?” the
watchman returned cheerily.</p>

<p>“It isn’t very good, not for me!” The boy’s face
clouded once more. “Mr. Blaisdell is going away on a
sketching tour for October. I—I wish I could go with
him! He’d take me but Dad won’t hear of it!”</p>

<p>The two listeners who had remained a little apart, saw
now that he carried a small leather portfolio and a sketch
book.</p>

<p>“An artist, the lad is!” Dennis exclaimed beneath his
breath. “It’s out playing baseball he should be, and getting
into a good healthy fight now and then. Look at the
hollow chest and spindly legs of him!”</p>

<p>“Poor little cuss!” McCarty murmured as Horace Goddard
with a parting word to the watchman passed them
with a mere glance of well-bred inquiry. “Say, Bill,
what’s that family doing to the kid? Making him learn
to paint?”</p>

<p>The watchman had strolled up to them once more and
at the question his grin broadened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“<em>Make</em> him? They can’t keep him away from it!
We’re great buddies, him and me, and he’s a lonesome
kind of a little feller and talks to me every chance he
gets. You heard what he said? This Blaisdell guy is
one of the greatest painters in the country and he met the
kid at Mr. Orbit’s house one day and took a fancy to
him. He let Horace come to his studio and watch him
work, it seems, and Horace began trying to copy him
and now he’s giving him regular lessons. Going to stroll
back? I take the other side of the street.”</p>

<p>“No, we’ll be looking in to see what arrangements Mr.
Orbit has made for the funeral.” McCarty touched
Dennis’ sleeve. “So long.”</p>

<p>“See you later.” Bill nodded and turned to cross to
the opposite sidewalk and his erstwhile companions started
back the way they had come.</p>

<p>“A lot you got out of him!” Dennis remarked.</p>

<p>“I got what I was looking for, dope on some of the
families and their servants,” replied McCarty. “I didn’t
want to crowd him too much at the first go, and besides,
we’ve no more time to spend on him just now.”</p>

<p>“Going to tackle that Chink again?” asked the other
innocently.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tackle every last mother’s son of them!”
McCarty set his lips firmly and his step quickened. “I
want a talk with Orbit, too, before the inspector breaks
the news.”</p>

<p>In response to their ring at the bell the door was
presently opened by a fat little Chinese boy, whose round,
yellow face was wreathed in smiles. On seeing them he
bowed straight forward from the waist with both short
arms spread wide and ushered them into a huge, dim
room at the left, where their footsteps rang on a bare,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
mosaic floor of exquisite design and inlay. McCarty
observed that the whole opposite wall was of glass, curving
out in a swelling arc, like a gigantic bow window. It
was filled with a mass of strange, vivid flowering plants,
the like of which neither of the visitors had ever seen
before, and a delicate, elusive fragrance hung upon the
super-heated atmosphere.</p>

<p>On their right, at the back, the pipes of an enormous
organ reared their slender tubes. Stone settles and
benches were scattered about, backed by towering masses
of palms and cacti, but the echoing, high-ceilinged room
held no other furnishing.</p>

<p>They seated themselves on the nearest marble bench and
McCarty, who was commencing to perspire freely, pulled
out his handkerchief and mopped his forehead.</p>

<p>“’Tis for all the world like that grand undertaker’s
where the lodge gave Corcoran his funeral!” Dennis had
spoken in his normal tones but they swiftly sank to a
hoarse whisper as they reverberated. “God save us, did
you hear that? It’s worse than a tunnel!”</p>

<p>“Wisht! The little heathen is still hanging around.”
McCarty admonished. “Come here, son.”</p>

<p>The little boy who had lingered in the doorway smiled
again and sidled forward silently in his soft embroidered
slippers.</p>

<p>“My name Fu Moy,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re the coffee boy?” McCarty remembered his
conversation with the butler.</p>

<p>“Can do!” Fu Moy bobbed his head delightedly at the
recognition.</p>

<p>“And is Ching Lee your father?” McCarty disregarded
the dissimilarity in family names.</p>

<p>“Ching Lee on-clee.” He labored over the difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
word with evident anxiety to make himself understood.</p>

<p>“Uncle, is he?” His questioner paused. “You know
Hughes?”</p>

<p>The round face clouded.</p>

<p>“Me catchum Mlistler Hughes. Me no like. Mlistler
Hughes gone away. Me glad.”</p>

<p>“That,” observed Dennis judiciously, “was straight
from the shoulder. I couldn’t have put it better myself
if I’d known the spalpeen!”</p>

<p>Fu Moy hung his head shyly but McCarty pulled a
shining new quarter from his pocket and held it out.</p>

<p>“You catchum some of those nuts with the raisins inside
for yourself—lichee.—But tell me first why you no
like Hughes.”</p>

<p>The small, yellow, claw-like hand closed avidly over the
coin.</p>

<p>“When Honorable Gleat Lord come, Mlistler Hughes
say Fu Moy velly nice boy. When Honorable Lord no
come, Mlistler Hughes kickee, stlikee, hurtee head, allee
time say Fu Moy go hellee.” The little slippered foot
shot out suggestively and he rubbed his ear in realistic
fashion.</p>

<p>“The dirty hound, for abusing and cursing a little
shaver, heathen or no!” Dennis exclaimed. “Who’s the
honorable lord, youngster? Mr. Orbit?”</p>

<p>Again Fu Moy nodded and a look of adoration shone
on the childish face.</p>

<p>“Can do!” His tone was fervid. “Honorable Lord
Orblit velley gleat man, allee same Lord High Plince!”</p>

<p>“So that’s that! We know how he stands with the kid,
all right,” McCarty interposed as Dennis started to speak
again. But Fu Moy had evidently struck a congenial
topic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“Ching Lee catchum Mlistler Hughes make do.” He
pulled up the sleeve of his embroidered silk jacket disclosing
the fresh, livid marks of five thick fingers on his
plump arm. “Ching Lee gettee knifee, can do!”</p>

<p>Fu Moy drew his hand across his throat and Dennis
shuddered.</p>

<p>“For the love of the saints!”</p>

<p>“When was this?” McCarty was careful to keep his
tone indifferent.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes—!”</p>

<p>“Yesterday?”</p>

<p>Fu Moy’s bullet head bobbed.</p>

<p>“Honorable Lord come takee knifee away from Ching
Lee, say no can do, p’leecee man would come. He say
Mlistler Hughes hurtee Fu Moy he go! Mlistler Hughes
gone. Honorable Lord one piecee gleat man.” He
looked down at the coin and then up with a sudden
thought. “Lichee nuts no can do! Slipples can do!
Slipples ’long Honorable Lord!”</p>

<p>He had gestured toward his feet and Dennis turned
puzzled eyes on his companion.</p>

<p>“Does the youngster mean that he wants to buy a pair
of slippers for Orbit?” Fu Moy’s expression was sufficient
answer, and Dennis suggested: “Sure, he must
have plenty of slippers, lad?”</p>

<p>Fu Moy’s head shook decisively.</p>

<p>“Allee blurn. Bang-bang flier Honorable Lord’s loom.
Littlee flier, gleat big bang-bang! Slipples ’longside
chair, all same blurn.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got him!” McCarty spoke aside in a hurried undertone;
to the little boy whose dark, bright, slant eyes
were fixed upon him as though for approval, he added:
“Sure, son! Get your honorable lord a pair of slippers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
and if you can find any for a quarter let me know where.
Now you run and tell him that two of the men who were
here last night would like to speak to him. Think you
can make him know what you mean?”</p>

<p>“Honorable lord—speakee—Mac and me—here?”
Dennis interpreted unexpectedly.</p>

<p>The child nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“Can do. Honorable Lord talkee my talk.” With
another bow he turned and trotted from the room, and
Dennis murmured:</p>

<p>“Could you beat that? Orbit speaks Chinee! That
kid was talking about the fire last night, but what did he
mean by ‘bang-bang’? Did somebody fire a shot, do you
suppose?”</p>

<p>“They did not!” McCarty replied impatiently. “Something
exploded in Orbit’s room and set fire to a chair and
the slippers under it, but that’s neither here nor there.
He’s a bright kid, little Fu Moy, with a gift of the gab
that I’m wishful his uncle had! Only yesterday this
Ching Lee tried to murder Hughes for mistreating the
child, but Orbit stopped him; Fu Moy’s just been told
that Hughes has gone away, Denny, and he thinks Orbit
discharged him and worships the boss accordingly. I
wonder if maybe Ching Lee tried again? I wonder if
he ever heard of the Calabar bean?”</p>

<span class="fs80">CHING LEE’S ERRAND</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“Good morning</span>, gentlemen.” Henry Orbit appeared
in the doorway and came forward. “Has
your inspector news for me about the removal of Hughes’
body? I have made all the arrangements.”</p>

<p>There was a weary note in his voice and the pallor of
fatigue had spread over his strongly marked features,
but it only added to the distinction of his appearance and
his eyes seemed if anything more brilliantly alight than on
the previous evening. A plum-colored house-robe swathed
the tall, erect figure, but he was immaculately groomed
and it was only when he had almost reached the visitors
that they saw he carried under one arm a tiny, wistful-eyed
monkey.</p>

<p>Dennis gave a start but McCarty replied quietly:</p>

<p>“The inspector gave us no message about the body, sir,
but no doubt you’ll hear from him any time now. We’d
like to fix the exact time Hughes left the house. The
last you saw of him was a little before seven, I think you
said. Was that before or after the fire in your room?”</p>

<p>“Some little time before. I have Vite, here, to thank
for that.” A faint smile curved Orbit’s mobile lips and
he stroked the little creature in his arm with a reassuring
gesture as it whimpered at the mention of its name. “An
alcohol cigar-lighter was left burning on my desk and in
his haste to follow me downstairs Vite knocked it over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
setting fire to an upholstered chair, but Fu Moy, the coffee
boy who admitted you just now, discovered it before
any further damage was done and summoned Ching
Lee. Fu Moy was as pleasantly excited about it as any
small American boy would have been, but he should not
have annoyed you with his chatter. I suppose it was he
who told you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I knew it last night,” Dennis remarked.
“I smelled it.”</p>

<p>“To be sure! I could not myself detect it downstairs
but when I retired the odor drove me to one of the guest
rooms and although I am an experienced traveler I do
not sleep well in unaccustomed surroundings; that is why
you find me still <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en déshabillé</i> at this hour.” He glanced
down at the house-robe and then added with a touch of
sadness in his voice. “To be truthful, I could not get
poor Hughes out of my thoughts. After all, twenty-two
years is a long time.”</p>

<p>“It is that, Mr. Orbit. When he laid out your clothes
and asked for the evening off, did he leave you at once?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I told him to go and have his dinner; the servants
always dine early when I am entertaining, for their
meals are prepared separately. That is how the cigar
lighter happened to be left burning. I can’t tell you what
time he went out but perhaps André or Jean would know,
or Ching Lee. André is the cook; shall I have him sent
to you here?”</p>

<p>“If it’s all the same to you we’ll go to the kitchen and
talk to him.” McCarty glanced at the mass of exotic
blooms, vividly ablaze where the sun poured in upon them
through the glass wall. “You’ve some wonderful flowers,
Mr. Orbit.”</p>

<p>“The orchids are rather rare; some of them have never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
been known to thrive above the equator before and the
cacti and palms usually do not grow north of Central
America. I’m quite proud of them. But come. I will
show you the way to the pantries and kitchen.”</p>

<p>McCarty gasped thankfully in the comparatively chill
atmosphere of the hall after the almost overpowering
heat of the conservatory and the two followed along a
narrowed hall toward the rear. Half-open double doors
at the left past the library revealed a great formal dining-room
and back of the conservatory, on the other side of
the wall against which the organ had been installed, there
appeared to be a combined picture gallery and card room,
for the walls were lined with paintings whose massive
frames all but touched and green-clothed tables of various
sizes stood about on the brightly waxed surface of the
marquetry floor.</p>

<p>“Ring the bell in the pantry for Fu Moy and he will
bring you to me if there are any questions you would
like to ask after you have seen André or Jean.” Orbit
had paused before a door at the end of the hall. “Ching
Lee is out at present but I shall be glad to give you any
assistance in my power. Since the inspector attached so
much importance to it I find that I am curious myself to
know what errand could have taken Hughes to the quarter
of town in which he died.—Beyond the butler’s pantry
you will find the kitchen pantries, the refrigerating room
and then the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“All right, then,” McCarty responded. “The chances
are that we won’t bother you again before we go.”</p>

<p>He pushed open the door as Orbit turned, and Dennis
followed him into the spacious white-tiled room shining
with glass and porcelain. A door further along in the
same wall as that by which they had entered evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
opened into the dining-room but McCarty led the way to
another facing them and they passed down a short corridor
and into a spacious kitchen.</p>

<p>A fat man immaculate in starched white apron and cap,
with a round, ruddy face and bristling black mustache
turned on them belligerently from a long pastry table.</p>

<p>“What is this, that you come to my kitchen? <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sacré
Nom!</i> If M’sieur Obeet know this—!”</p>

<p>“Don’t let that worry you, André! Mr. Orbit just
showed us the way through the pantry,” McCarty interrupted.
“We’d like to ask you a few questions about
Hughes.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu! Les gendarmes!</i>” André raised his floury
hands in dismay.</p>

<p>“What’s that you’re calling us?” demanded Dennis
advancing truculently and the fat chef retreated behind
the table in haste.</p>

<p>“‘Gendarmes’ it is French for Messieurs of the
Police!” he stammered, his conciliatory tone comically at
variance with the fierce expression lent to him by the
bristling mustache. “I know nothing of Hughes, nothing!
He goes out last night upon his own affairs and in
the morning Ching Lee comes to me and tells me that he
is dead, he falls in the street with a—a seekness of the
heart. Is it not so? <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Alors</i>, why do the police interest
themselves?”</p>

<p>“Ching Lee told you that, did he?” McCarty seated himself
and Dennis took a chair by the door. “Did you ever
hear Hughes complain of a weak heart?”</p>

<p>“But no! It—it was something else, then, which have
killed Hughes?” André asked quickly, then checked himself
with a shrug. “What is it that you would have me
tell you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“How long have you worked for Mr. Orbit?”</p>

<p>“It will be seex years next month. I am chef for a
friend of M’sieu in Paris and when he is kill’ in the war
M’sieu send for me. When the war it is finish’ M’sieu
permits that my cousin Jean who was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poilu</i> come also to
be houseman. Jean and me, we do not concern ourselves
with the affairs of Hughes, we know of him nothing!”</p>

<p>“Who comes here to see him, besides Snape, the butler
from next door?” McCarty asked.</p>

<p>“No one.” André wiped his hands and came slowly
around the table. “It is not often that we see Snape, for
he arrive’ in the evening late, and when the dinner is
finish’ Jean and me, we have our own affairs together.”</p>

<p>“What time did you and the rest have dinner last
night?” McCarty dropped the futile line of questioning.
“It was before you served Mr. Orbit and his company,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“But yes. At seex hours and a half.” The reply
came promptly, in obvious relief.</p>

<p>“Did Hughes eat with you?”</p>

<p>“Of a certainty!” André looked his surprise. “Fu
Moy arrange’ the tables in our dining-room there—one
for himself and Ching Lee, who prefers that they eat
alone together, and the other for us three, but Hughes he
is late, he attend upon M’sieu. Ching Lee and Fu Moy
have almost finish’ and Jean and me, we think we will
wait no longer when at last Hughes he comes.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you he was going out?”</p>

<p>“Not until after dinner. Ching Lee have gone to make
complete the table for M’sieu and his guests and Fu Moy
to robe himself in the little jaquette of embroidered satin
that later he may serve coffee and liqueurs. Then Hughes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
says that he will go for a walk. Jean warns him that it
will make rain—how you say? A storm, it is coming,
but Hughes does not care, it is for his health that he
walks. Jean and me, we think that is droll for there is
nothing the matter with the health of Hughes, only that
he drinks too much and often he is out very late.” Again
André checked himself and then went on hurriedly. “It
is the last month, perhaps two, that he is not look so well,
but he is not seek, nevaire. He goes, and—”</p>

<p>“What time was this?” McCarty interrupted.</p>

<p>“At a little past seven hours, perhaps half, but me, I am
engage’ with the dinner of M’sieu, and Jean he cleans our
dishes; we pay not much attention. Hughes says ‘good
night’ and goes out the side door here into the allee which
leads to the tradesmen’s entrance. That is the end of
Hughes.”</p>

<p>With a gesture of dismissal he turned to the range and
tested the heat regulator of the oven, but McCarty remained
seated.</p>

<p>“The fire broke out in Mr. Orbit’s room after Hughes
left, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You have heard of that?” André turned again
with uplifted brows. “It was nothing, we do not even
know of it until it is all over. Little Fu Moy, he see the
smoke and the single tongue of flame and he cry for
Ching Lee who puts it out. M’sieu, he is downstairs
awaiting his guests and it is said that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">singe</i>—the
monkey—Vite have upset the cigar lighter, but me, I
think it is Fu Moy who makes play with the matches!
He is a bad child, that little Fu Moy!”</p>

<p>“You say that Hughes has not looked so well lately,”
McCarty ignored the subject of the coffee boy’s delinquencies.
“Did he seem worried, like, or as if anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
was on his mind that might have hurt his health, weakened
his heart, maybe?”</p>

<p>André shrugged once more.</p>

<p>“He is if anything in the greater spirits and Jean and
me, we think that he have win at the cards. He looks—how
do you say?—dissipate’, and tired because he creeps
in with the dawn.”</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Orbit know of this?” McCarty feigned surprise.
“It’s a wonder he’d have kept him.”</p>

<p>“If he suspects he says nothing, because no matter how
late Hughes arrive at home he is always up promptly in
the morning and he drinks only when M’sieu shall not
know. He is the perfect valet and M’sieu asks no more.”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t either, just now.” Dennis had taken
no part in the inquiry but now as McCarty spoke he
signaled him an agonized glance and the latter nodded.</p>

<p>“André, when did that fire break out?” Dennis drew
a deep breath.</p>

<p>“Last night? It must have been but a moment or two
after the departure of Hughes for it is still less than eight
hours when it is finish, before the three gentlemen arrive.”</p>

<p>“Before you knew of it, then,—say, a few minutes
after Hughes left; did you hear anything?” Dennis pursued
carefully. “A kind of a bang! it would be, like a
firecracker going off, if you know what that is.”</p>

<p>“The red fire toys of Fu Moy which explode when he
lights them? I know!” André responded grimly. Then
a reflective look came over his round countenance. “It
appears that I did hear a single, quick noise, like the
violent closing of a door somewhere above which make
the house to tremble! Me, I am occupied with the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chateaubriand</i>, that it cook not too fast, and I think not
of it again. But what—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing. That’s all I wanted to know.” Dennis
turned to his companion. “Let’s be moving, Mac.”</p>

<p>He started along the corridor but McCarty stopped him
at the foot of a narrow, winding staircase.</p>

<p>“We’ll go up here, Denny, for a minute. I want a look
around.”</p>

<p>“No more than I do, myself!” Dennis returned
promptly. “It’s beginning to come to me that Hughes
was not over popular around here. I wonder what this
Jean thought of him?”</p>

<p>What Jean thought was speedily ascertained for they
came upon him in the upper hall, energetically waxing the
floor; a slim, dark, youngish man with a deep scar across
his smooth-shaven face and a nervous, jerky manner as
though every muscle and nerve were strung on wires.</p>

<p>“It was unfortunate that Hughes should have died so
suddenly but what would you? A man so gross, who ate
like a great pig and drank like a sot and took no care of
himself,” Jean replied to his own observation with a shrug
and applied his energies anew to his task.</p>

<p>“Where were you last evening, Jean, while Fu Moy
was setting the tables in the servants’ dining-room?” McCarty
asked, as though in an afterthought.</p>

<p>“In the kitchen assisting André. It is not my work
but André is occupied with the dinner of Monsieur Orbit.
I arrange first the trays for Fu Moy and he take them to
the table and then call his uncle, Ching Lee. André and
me, we await Hughes—”</p>

<p>“So Ching Lee and Fu Moy ate alone in the dining-room
for awhile before Hughes came down, and you and
him and André went in to have your own dinners?”</p>

<p>“Yes, m’sieu.” Jean had risen from his knees and
now he regarded his questioner expectantly but for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
moment McCarty seemed lost in thought. Then he
roused himself.</p>

<p>“What did you have?”</p>

<p>“A soup of vegetables, ragout of lamb, a salad and
cheese and coffee,” Jean responded. “There was rice
also for Ching Lee and Fu Moy, and pastry from
Monsieur Orbit’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</i>, which I placed for Hughes
but he desired it not.”</p>

<p>“Did he eat as much as usual?” McCarty asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Like a glutton at first but he is finished very soon, he
is satisfied and the remainder of his dinner goes almost
untouched. Then he goes out for a walk, so he tells to
André and me, in spite of the storm which is coming.”
Jean’s face twisted in a grimace of knowing incredulity.
“It takes him not five minutes to change and then he is
gone.”</p>

<p>“Did you help André dish up the dinner for Mr. Orbit
and his friends?”</p>

<p>“I assist him, but it is soon over, for when the guests
are only gentlemen the menu is very simple though always
of the best. At half past eight dinner is served and
in an hour it is finished and we are making all clean in the
kitchen. Some French papers have arrived for us in the
mail but yesterday and we take them to André’s room to
read; at eleven we go to bed.”</p>

<p>The man spoke glibly enough, but why without being
asked had he volunteered a detailed account of how he
had spent the evening? Did he consider it necessary to
establish an alibi, and if so, what reason had he? There
was a frank, open look to him, McCarty thought, and
anyway there would be no sense in disputing with him
now; even if he was lying André would back up that
statement of his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“Do all of you sleep on the same floor?”</p>

<p>Jean nodded.</p>

<p>“At the top of the house. Shall I show you—?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll be taking a look around later, maybe. What
else is on this floor besides Mr. Orbit’s room?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur’s suite,” Jean corrected. “He has a private
sitting-room also, in addition to the bedroom and dressing-room.
The rest of this floor and all of the one above
are arranged in suites for guests.”</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Orbit have much company staying here in
the house?” McCarty’s gaze had wandered to the many
doors on either side of the broad corridor.</p>

<p>“Not many. Only one or two at a time have I seen
since I came, and all gentlemen. Never are ladies guests
of the house although often they dine here or arrive for
the affairs of society which Monsieur gives.—But I must
arrange the table now for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</i>, because Ching Lee
is out.”</p>

<p>He gathered up his brushes and started for the back
stairs but McCarty stopped him.</p>

<p>“Where did Ching Lee go? Did Orbit send him on an
errand?”</p>

<p>“I do not think so.” Jean hesitated. “When Monsieur
sends him—which is but seldom, for nearly always
I go,—he tucks up his queue and arrays himself in American
attire, but to-day, as when he goes about his own affairs,
he wore the ordinary dress of his country; not
the magnificent embroidered robes of silk but the plain,
dark dress one sees upon <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les Chinois</i> everywhere. It is
now two hours since he has gone.”</p>

<p>He turned once more to the stairs and this time McCarty
made no effort to detain him. He waited until the
houseman’s footsteps had died away in the hall below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
and a door had closed. Then he turned to where Dennis
had been standing just behind him.</p>

<p>“Get that, Denny? I’m thinking—!” He paused, for
he was talking to the empty air. Dennis had disappeared.</p>

<p>With a shrug McCarty mounted to the next floor but no
one was visible and each of the several doors which he
opened gave upon bedrooms furnished in different periods
of the Italian and French monarchical régimes. He only
knew that they seemed very handsome, if the rugs and
draperies did look a bit faded and draggled to his eyes
and the gilt tarnished, but about all there hung the aloof,
cheerless air of apartments seldom tenanted.</p>

<p>The floor above was evidently cut up into many smaller
rooms, for there were more doors closer together. Several
of them were locked and the first which opened
readily was that of a large room at the back, furnished
merely with two chests of drawers and two matting covered
cots heaped with cushions. Matting was laid upon
the floor, a niche in the wall was hung with rich silk upon
which a gorgeous dragon was emblazoned and lanterns
were suspended from the ceiling. McCarty sniffed the
faintly aromatic odor as of sandalwood which greeted
him and knew that this must be the room Ching Lee
shared with Fu Moy.</p>

<p>Closing the door he retraced his steps and tried another
just at the head of the stairs. It opened into a
room slightly smaller than the first but comfortably furnished
in old oak with a bright rug on the floor and simple
curtains at the two broad windows. Military brushes and
other masculine toilet accessories were scattered on the
dresser and a rack which hung beside it glowed with the
rich, subdued colors of a score or more neckties and
scarves. Across the foot of the bed lay a lounging robe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
of heavily quilted brocade but somewhat worn and frayed.</p>

<p>Was this where one of the Frenchmen slept or—?
McCarty strode to the closet and flung the door wide.
Suits of plain black alternated with others of conservative
shades and material but far more expensive; a glance
showed that they were much too large for the slender
houseman, yet not sufficiently capacious to accommodate
the chef’s rotund girth.</p>

<p>If this, then, were Hughes’ room could he have left any
clue behind him which would point to his unknown
enemy? A hasty examination of the closet revealed an
empty whiskey bottle among the boots on the floor, but
the pockets of the various garments contained merely
small bills and newspaper clippings of racing results.</p>

<p>In the top drawer of the dresser McCarty came upon
a stack of letters in different handwriting but all unmistakably
feminine and sentimental in tone, couched in
more or less illiterate terms. He took possession of them
for reading at his leisure. The lower drawers contained
only clothing and there were no other receptacles in the
room which might have held papers but his experienced
eye noted a slight unevenness in the surface of the rug
near the head of the bed and turning it back he found a
bank-book and a check-book fastened together with a
rubber band.</p>

<p>These he pocketed also and then descended to the first
bedroom floor where Dennis had deserted him, to discover
that individual hovering uncertainly about the
stairs’ head.</p>

<p>“Where the devil did you take yourself off to?” he demanded.
“If the inspector let you in on this with me
’twas not to gum up my game, Denny Riordan! Moreover,
whenever you go off on your own hook—!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“Let be, Mac! The inspector’s here, talking to Orbit
now in his private sitting-room, they all but caught me
snooping around in there!” Dennis interrupted. “He’s
sprung it on him that Hughes was poisoned!”</p>

<p>“Come on downstairs and tell me what you heard.”
McCarty led the way without further waste of words and
Dennis followed him to the entrance hall below where they
stationed themselves in the embrasure of a window beside
the door.</p>

<p>“Whilst you were asking Jean about the layout of the
rooms upstairs I thought I’d have a look at the ones Orbit
keeps for himself,” Dennis explained in a slightly defiant
tone. “He sleeps in a bed with a roof to it, all hung with
curtains like a hearse. The chair that was burned is
gone but there’s a scorched place in the rug and the smell
is hanging on the air yet. I took just a peep in the bathroom,
which is fitted up like a gymnasium and almost as
big, and then I went on into the sitting-room. ’Tis grand,
Mac, with books and pictures and flowers everywhere, to
say nothing of the window boxes just ablaze with
flowers for all it’s near frost. There’s a piano, too, with
big sheets of paper covered with hen-tracks on the rack
as if somebody’d been writing music by hand, and I was
just looking at it when I heard the inspector’s voice and
him and Orbit coming along the hall. I ducked back into
the bedroom and then I stopped for I caught the last word
the inspector was saying; it was ‘murder!’”</p>

<p>It was an unprecedentedly long speech for the taciturn
Dennis and as he paused for breath McCarty rubbed his
chin reflectively.</p>

<p>“How did Orbit take it?”</p>

<p>“For a full minute you could have cut the stillness with
a knife and then he says low and shocked, like: ‘My God,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
how frightful! You’re sure there’s no possibility of a
mistake about it, inspector? But your man who witnessed
it said nothing last night about foul play! I
understand that poor Hughes simply dropped in the
street when no one was near.’ Then the inspector up and
told him it was poison, giving it that long name ‘physos’-something,
and Orbit says could it be possible, that he’d
heard of it, of course, being a bit of a bot—botanist, but
’twas rare, and how could anybody have got hold of it
to give to Hughes, and why?” Dennis paused again and
then added conscientiously: “Maybe them wasn’t just the
words, Mac, but he was struck all of a heap. I was
afraid they’d be coming in and catching me so I beat it
out to the head of the stairs where you found me.—Wisht!
They’re coming down now!”</p>

<p>“I’ll be waiting for a word with the inspector,” McCarty
announced hurriedly. “I’ve a job for you, Denny
if you’ll not be shooting your mouth off!”</p>

<p>A door above had opened but it was evident that Orbit
and his companion had paused, for no sound of footsteps
ensued and Dennis asked eagerly:</p>

<p>“What is it, Mac? Well you know I’m not given to
talk—!”</p>

<p>“Then listen! Run down to the old waterfront precinct
and see is Mike Taggart or Terry around; tell them
I stopped by the fire house this morning on the way out
to my Homevale estates and mentioned the fellow that
dropped dead down there last night, and you thought from
my description maybe you knew him. You’re disgusted
that I took so little interest and it’s your opinion I’m not
the man I was—”</p>

<p>“And who says so?” demanded Dennis with loyal indignation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>“You do, you blockhead!” McCarty retorted. “Let
them knock me and get all the dope you can about last
night, and then bring up old times when I walked my
beat there and you used to come around for a word with
me and the rest of the boys. Say the neighborhood
looks about the same to you but you kind of recall seeing
more Chinks hanging out in the doorways, and wasn’t
there a laundry or a chop suey joint on the block?”</p>

<p>“’Tis you should know there wasn’t!” Dennis’ tone
was bewildered but a light suddenly dawned in his gray
eyes and he added in a sepulchral whisper: “Mac! You
don’t mean—! You’re thinking—!”</p>

<p>“I’m wishful to know if there was a strange Chinaman
in that street this morning; one that was curious, maybe,
about what happened last night. If there was, his queue
might have been tucked up or swinging free, but I’ve a
hunch he’d look like Ching Lee!”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Dennis</span> had scarcely departed on his errand when
the inspector and Orbit came down the stairs together
and the latter remarked to McCarty:</p>

<p>“You didn’t tell me Hughes had been poisoned!”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” McCarty agreed. “’Twas not for me to
say: I told you I’d no message for you about the body
but you’d hear from the inspector. There’s no chance he
could have took that Calabar bean powder—I disremember
its other name,—by mistake, is there? Would it be
lying around the house here for any purpose?”</p>

<p>“Hardly!” Orbit smiled. “I have read of its use as a
cure for lockjaw and an antidote for some other poison—strychnine,
I believe,—but one would not find it in an
ordinary, normal household!—You’ll let me know, inspector,
if I can do anything to further your investigation?”</p>

<p>The inspector promised, somewhat superfluously, and
as they descended the steps he observed to his companion:</p>

<p>“It’s a damn funny case, Mac! The Bellamy woman’s
butler is a smooth proposition, but as far as I could make
out he came clean; he’s been playing the races with
Hughes in a poolroom down on Thirtieth and gambling
in a joint over on the East Side, and Hughes was stuck
on some new Jane named ‘Gertie.’ Snape thinks she’s
a married woman, though he never saw her nor heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
her last name, and she doesn’t belong on this block. He
wasn’t with Hughes last night and didn’t even know he’d
gone out.”</p>

<p>“Did you see anybody else in that house?” asked McCarty.</p>

<p>“Only a mighty pretty nursemaid going out with a
baby. Did you have any luck at Orbit’s?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” McCarty responded guardedly. “I’ll tell
you later if you’ll drop around to my rooms. I want
to have another talk with the stout, bald little guy next
door here, Goddard.”</p>

<p>“All right. I think we’re wasting our time, though,
here in the Mall. If we can trace Hughes’ movements
from the minute he passed out of that gate there until
he fell dying in front of you, we’ll nail the fellow who
slipped him that Calabar bean; there won’t be much to
this case, Mac.”</p>

<p>McCarty watched the inspector cross the street to the
stately old entrance to Number Seven and then proceeded
to the corner house and rang the bell. An elderly
butler, with the pallor of a long lifetime of indoor service
admitted him, shaking his head dubiously. It was
some little time before Eustace Goddard appeared.</p>

<p>“’Pon my soul, you fellows are persistent!” His blue
eyes twinkled with lively curiosity as he spoke. “Never
knew of such a fuss being made over the death of a servant
before! I suppose you’ve come to question mine?”</p>

<p>“After a bit,” McCarty smiled grimly. “Servant or
no, we’re bound to make a fuss, as you call it, when it’s a
case of murder.”</p>

<p>“What? You don’t say so!” Goddard ran his hand
over the fringe of sandy hair adorning his bald pate.
“Devil of a thing for Orbit, the notoriety and all!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Can’t see why he kept the fellow; I never did like his
looks!—But who killed him?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’re asking!” McCarty retorted. “First
of all we’ve got to fix the time he left the house. Did
you see him when you went there to dinner last night?”</p>

<p>“No. It was about quarter past eight and just beginning
to rain when I went next door. Ching Lee admitted
me and I found Orbit in the library; the Sloanes came a
few minutes later and we four went in to dinner and then
played a rubber or two of bridge. I’ve never seen Orbit
in better form; he’s a splendid player but last night his
game was extraordinary and we had a rattling good time
until you fellows showed up!”</p>

<p>“You weren’t playing cards when we got there,” McCarty
suggested.</p>

<p>“No, we’d finished and gone into the conservatory.
Orbit was at the organ; you must have heard him.”
Goddard spoke in short, jerky sentences as though out
of breath and a deeper flush had mounted in his ruddy
cheeks. “Don’t pretend to know much about music myself
but Orbit can make those pipes talk and I never
heard him play as he did last night! His own composition,
too; he’s a genius!”</p>

<p>“You’ve known him long?”</p>

<p>“God bless me, yes! He was my idol when I was a
little boy and he a big one, home from school for the holidays.
Then came the university and after that he traveled
for some years, returning only at his father’s sudden
death. He brought Hughes back with him then.”
Goddard checked himself as though recalled all at once to
a consciousness of his visitor’s identity. “About last
night, though, I saw none of the servants except Ching
Lee and Fu Moy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“Have those two been with Orbit a long while?”</p>

<p>“Ching Lee has; little Fu Moy only appeared a year
or so ago. But Orbit himself can tell you—”</p>

<p>“You visit in there a lot, don’t you?” McCarty interrupted.</p>

<p>“Naturally, when Mr. Orbit is in residence.” A shade
of stiffness had manifested itself in the genial, garrulous
tones. “He frequently closed the house and went away
for long trips, although not of late years!”</p>

<p>“Then you must have seen a good deal of Hughes,” persisted
the interrogator.</p>

<p>Goddard shook his head decisively and his small, reddish
mustache seemed to fairly bristle.</p>

<p>“As I told you last night I have hardly addressed the
fellow half a dozen times in my life. He was self-effacing,
like any other well-trained servant; you’d scarcely
know he was there. Then, too, I never had much occasion
to see him, for though such old friends Orbit and
I have not been on an intimate footing; Mrs. Goddard and
I dine there or I run over for an evening of bridge now
and then, that’s about the extent of our intercourse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dad!” The clear, treble voice which McCarty
had already heard sounded from the hall and the red-haired,
delicate-looking boy appeared in the doorway.
“Dad, that old Hughes is dead! Now he’ll never be horrid
to Max any more when he follows me over to Mr.
Orbit’s!”</p>

<p>“Run away, Horace!” Goddard ordered peremptorily.
“Dad’s busy—!”</p>

<p>“So Hughes was horrid to Max, was he?” McCarty
interrupted with the broad, ingratiating smile which always
won juvenile confidence. “And who is Max, my
lad?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“My police dog. Hughes was afraid of him, and
that’s why he tried to kick him out. It’s lucky Mr. Orbit
didn’t see him; he never lets anything be hurt—”</p>

<p>The boy was replying courteously, in simple friendliness,
when his father interrupted:</p>

<p>“Horace, it’s time you got ready for lunch. Look at
your hands!”</p>

<p>“That’s paint, Dad; it won’t come off, but I’ll try
again.” He nodded, his wistful, sensitive face breaking
into a smile and then went off down the hall while Goddard
remarked:</p>

<p>“That boy of mine is crazy to be an artist and he runs
next door now and then to see Orbit’s paintings. Never
took much stock in that sort of thing myself. Sorry
I can’t give you any further information about that
valet, but I don’t see why you should come to me, anyway!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got the finest house on the block, except
the closed-up one just over the way, and I supposed you’d
know the folks that live in the others,” McCarty explained.
“Does any of them do anything but clip
coupons?”</p>

<p>“We all know each other, of course.” There was a
softened note of genial patronage in his tone. “I don’t
know what it can have to do with your investigation but
we’re none of us what you would probably call the
‘idle rich.’ I manage several estates for relatives besides
my own, Burminster over there works harder than any
of his clerks, looking after his enormous holdings, Gardner
Sloane—whom you met last night—is a prominent
banker, Benjamin Parsons a philanthropist and Mrs.
Bellamy’s late husband was a broker. Orbit doesn’t go
in for finance, his money is all soundly invested, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
don’t believe he touches half his income, but his contributions
to art and science and literature have been almost
incalculable.”</p>

<p>“Have they, so!” interjected McCarty, considerably
impressed. “And are the Burminsters and the Parsons
friends of Orbit, too?”</p>

<p>“The Burminsters, yes, but when I said we all knew
each other here in the Mall I spoke generally. The Parsons
are comparative strangers to all of us, although they
have been here for two generations—no, three—Benjamin
Parsons’ young niece makes the third. No one
here between these gates knows them.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with them?” McCarty demanded, adding
with a very sober countenance: “Wasn’t there time
in the two generations to get acquainted?”</p>

<p>Goddard shrugged.</p>

<p>“Not in their estimation, evidently. From the beginning
they held themselves aloof and made it plain that
they wanted no social intercourse with the rest of us here;
they live in a world of their own and for years none of
us has tried to invade it. Orbit’s newer than they—his
father bought that house next door within my memory,—but
he’s a different sort.”</p>

<p>“Yet you’re not intimate with him, you tell me. Who
are his close friends, informal-like? You’d know that,
being his neighbor.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing at all about Orbit’s friends, and I
fail to see what they’d have to do with his valet’s murder!”
Goddard flared out. “I’ve been pretty patient with
you, but this is a confounded impertinence! Why don’t
you look up the associates of the fellow himself and not
annoy us with such an affair? He was killed miles away
from here in some vile slum, as I understand it; it’s insufferable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
that Orbit’s neighbors should be dragged into
your investigation!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be annoying you no longer just now,” McCarty
responded equably as he rose. “I’ll just have a
word with your help to put in my report, though, before
I go.”</p>

<p>Neither the butler nor the cook had any information
of value to offer, however, and the maids employed upstairs
gave equally valueless testimony. All had known
Hughes by sight for years and had spoken to him occasionally
in casual greeting but it was plain that they had
not approved of him and were not particularly interested
in his death.</p>

<p>“And them living next door to him for twenty years
and more! ’Tis not in nature!” Dennis exclaimed, an
hour later, when he and McCarty met by prearrangement
at a modest East Side lunchroom and the latter disgustedly
voiced his opinion of the apathetic Goddard staff.
“There’s no woman too old to be curious about a neighbor’s
sudden death, if it’s only for the gossip of it! You
didn’t let on ’twas poison got him?”</p>

<p>“I did not! I told Goddard himself it was murder but
he thinks somebody killed Hughes down there in what he
calls a ‘vile slum.’” McCarty paused to give their order
to the slatternly waitress and then leaning his elbows on
the table he asked eagerly: “What did you find out in
the old precinct? Did you see Mike Taggart or
Terry?”</p>

<p>“The both of them!” It was Dennis’ turn to evince
disgust. “Conceited young pups they are, the day!
Terry’s clean forgot he put Hughes down as an ordinary
alcoholic case and Mike that he misread the tag on the
key-ring, but they were having the laugh on you for seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
a man die of poison under your nose and not getting
wise! They didn’t laugh much, though, after I began
asking about the old chop suey joints and Chink laundries!”</p>

<p>“So you spilled it, after all!” McCarty accused indignantly.
“I might have known you would!”</p>

<p>“I spilled nothing but what I was told,” retorted Dennis,
with an underlying hint of dogged satisfaction in his
tone. “’Twas not my fault they guessed, dumb as they
are! They took it all in till I sprung that and even then
Terry began telling me there was a laundry around the
corner and a chop suey joint back on the next block but
Mike broke in and asked me what the hell I was getting
at; what did I know about the Chink that had been hanging
around there not an hour before, and what in blazes
you were up to now? Man, dear, ’twould have done your
heart good to see the faces on them! I said you were
foreclosing a mortgage out at Homevale, and ’twas themselves
had spoke of the guy being poisoned, not me, and
what Chink were they talking about? There was no fooling
them then, though, they were wise, but Terry told
me about the tall Chinaman with a face like a graven
image who used good plain English even if he did sing it,
and I knew it was Ching Lee, all right!”</p>

<p>“What about him?” McCarty demanded: “If he went
to the station-house asking about Hughes when ’twas
not even in the morning papers that the body’d been
identified ’tis a wonder they didn’t run him in on general
principles!”</p>

<p>“Ching Lee is not that foolish!” Dennis lowered the
knife, upon the end of which he had balanced a section
of ham. “He told them he’d heard two other Chinks
in that chop suey joint where he had his breakfast talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
about one of their own countrymen who had fallen down
dead in front of the station-house last night, and though
the proprietor of the restaurant had said it was a white
man, American, who had died, he had come there to make
sure, being anxious about his brother.—Seems brother
was to have met him the night before but didn’t show up,
or some such stall, and that he had a weak heart. Anyway,
them two bright lads fell for it, told him the guy
that croaked was white and I misdoubt but they let drop
a hint that it was more than heart disease killed him.
’Twas only when I come around with my questions they
began to see that maybe they’d pulled a bloomer.—Where
the devil and all is our coffee?”</p>

<p>The coffee appeared and when they had finished it McCarty
asked:</p>

<p>“What did you do then? You’ve not been all this long
while kidding the boys at the house!”</p>

<p>“I have not,” Dennis admitted with some complacency.
“I left them looking like they’d got a comic valentine,
and having time yet on my hands before I was to meet you
I took a roundabout way to that chop suey joint, got a
table hid behind the proprietor’s desk and ordered some
heathenish mess. The proprietor’s a jolly, fat old Chink
and I was trying to think up some way of bringing Ching
Lee into our talk when who should come strolling in but
Terry in plain clothes! He was off duty, of course, but
he could not leave the matter be. The minute the old
Chink lamped him he drew down his eyelids like the hood
of an owl and pretended he couldn’t understand English,
but I was watching his face and I got wise that he knew
Ching Lee all right! I could have laughed, thinking how
he’d been jabbering to me but he fooled Terry and the
lunkhead went away at last without even catching sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
of me behind the desk!—Give me that check and let’s beat
it.”</p>

<p>They left the lunchroom and started westward again,
McCarty seemingly lost in his own thoughts, until Dennis
observed with a touch of impatience:</p>

<p>“I don’t get the meaning of it at all! We know Ching
Lee was ready to knife Hughes only yesterday and if he
did slip that Calabar bean into his food the while him and
Fu Moy was alone in their dining-room and then heard
later from us that it had worked all right, you’d think he
would just sit tight and wait for what was coming next
instead of trailing down to the station-house to make himself
conspicuous! Wasn’t he the one that identified the
body to us as being Hughes’, and wouldn’t he figger Terry
and Mike would have been told of who the dead guy was,
even if it hadn’t come out in the morning papers? If he
wanted to know whether the autopsy’d showed poison or
not he’d only have had to wait for the next edition!
Yet, when you had that hunch ’twas there he’d gone this
morning you must have doped out that he had some good
reason for it; what put the notion in your head to send
me down there, Mac?”</p>

<p>But McCarty made strange answer.</p>

<p>“If he’d been in a hurry to get there he’d have took
the subway over here.” They were crossing Lexington
Avenue, proceeding toward the Park. “Even if he’d
walked it all the way he would have got down to the
waterfront before nine, providing he took the most direct
route, unless he stopped somewhere. He was in a hurry
when he left the house but that might have been because
of the storm coming; he was in no hurry to get where
we found him, for all he was trying to run when he fell.
Now what—?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>His voice trailed away into silence and his companion
shrugged in exasperation.</p>

<p>“’Tis like talking to the empty air to ask you a civil
question these days, what with your new learning, but if
you’re asking me one, and it’s about Hughes last night,
I’ll remind you of what you said coming over in the
taxi; that maybe he wasn’t bound for anywhere in particular
but just wandering along, crazed by delirium and
suffering. According to what the inspector told us concerning
the action of that Calabar bean, he must have
been in fierce pain before paralysis set in the lungs of
him. It might have been then he stopped somewhere,
though he could have been staggering and lurching around
the streets for hours between the New Queen’s Mall and
the waterfront.”</p>

<p>McCarty shook his head.</p>

<p>“If you’ll call to mind, too, Denny, the inspector said
the effect of the poison wouldn’t be felt for maybe a couple
of hours, the amount he’d took of it. It come on him sudden,
and that when he was near the old precinct, and it
worked quick to the end. I’m not making little of the
inspector’s power of persuasion but I wish we’d had the
first shot at that Snape!—Look here, how much have you
got on you?”</p>

<p>“Nine dollars and sixty-two cents.” Dennis replied
with the promptitude of certainty but he eyed the questioner
askance.</p>

<p>“I’ll get fifty for you before night. Thanks be, that
sporting butler of Mrs. Bellamy’s has never laid eyes on
either of us, and you’ve the luck of Old Nick with the
cards! Come evening, you’ll be—”</p>

<p>“Come six o’clock this night I’ll be on duty for twenty-four
solid hours, if you’ll remember!” Dennis interrupted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
regretfully but firmly. “If you were fixing for me to sit
in a little game with Snape after scraping acquaintance
with him, to find out maybe what the inspector overlooked
I’d like nothing better, and I misdoubt but that if you
take it on instead you’ll be losing the clothes off your
back! Could you not let it go till to-morrow night?”</p>

<p>The note of solicitude in his tone was lost upon McCarty
in whose bosom the aspersion cast upon his poker
ability rankled.</p>

<p>“If I’m losing the last stitch on me ’twill not be through
playing close to my chest, like some!” he asserted darkly.
“I was going back through the gate to have another talk
with the Sloanes, if so be I’d find them in this time of day,
but they’ll keep, and I’ve a check-book and some letters
in my pocket that may give us as good a line on Hughes
as Snape himself could; besides, the inspector’ll be dropping
in for the good word. Come on till we hop a bus
up to the cross-town.”</p>

<p>Arriving before the entrance which led to McCarty’s
rooms they were astonished to see the door of the antique
shop beside it open and the inspector himself emerge.</p>

<p>“Where have you two been?” he asked sharply. “I
haven’t time to go upstairs but unlock the door, Mac, and
we’ll step inside. Your friend Ballard of the ‘Bulletin’
has been hanging around; how in hell did he know you
were in on this Hughes case?”</p>

<p>McCarty considerately forebore to glance at Dennis’
chagrined countenance as he swung the door wide, but
it was obvious to his own mind that the ubiquitous reporter
must have been in touch with Mike or Terry at the
station-house since his loyal but bungling assistant’s visit
of the morning.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir,” he replied innocently. “I’ve not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
laid eyes on Jimmie this long while.—But what’s up?
I left you heading for Parsons’ house; did you get any
dope from the old man about the hat, maybe?”</p>

<p>“How did you know he was old?” Inspector Druet
countered.</p>

<p>“Goddard was after telling me he was a philanthropist
and youth don’t turn to charity, as a rule,” observed McCarty.
“Moreover he’s got a grown niece, and they’ve
small use for any of their neighbors in spite of the millions
around them.”</p>

<p>“So I gathered,” remarked the inspector dryly. “Parsons
is a fine-looking old man with a face like a saint and
a voice like a preacher, but he’s stern and unbending as a
ramrod! He could not recognize the hat and he knew
no one in the New Queen’s Mall; his sister took no interest
in society, his niece had her own friends beyond
the gates and he himself was engrossed in affairs which
required all his time and attention. I figured the old
gentleman would thaw when I said every one knew of the
great good he’d done with his model tenements and playgrounds,
and free hospital and shelters, but he shut me
up as though I’d made a break and told me he was only
a steward. He undoubtedly had seen the man, Hughes, if
he’d been employed for twenty years or more in a house
across the way, but he didn’t recognize him and he’d never
heard his name. Death by violence was a very dreadful
thing and he only regretted his inability to aid the cause
of justice.”</p>

<p>“Was it the bunk, do you think, inspector?” Dennis
asked. “Him talking like a book and all?”</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head.</p>

<p>“He’s an old-fashioned gentleman, Riordan, the kind
you don’t often see nowadays, and his charities speak for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
themselves for all that he doesn’t celebrate them with a
brass band. But it brought me no nearer to getting a line
on Hughes, nor did the talk I had with his servants;
they’re not allowed to associate with any others on the
block and had never talked to Hughes though they knew
him by sight. There was one queer thing about that interview,
though; I could swear that I’d seen one or two
of them before but I couldn’t place them.”</p>

<p>“So you drew a blank in the Parsons house?” McCarty
commented. “So did I at the Goddard’s and as Denny
says, ’tis not natural. The neighbors’ help may not have
liked Hughes, or be scared now of mixing up in this
mess, but they’re bound to have known him in all these
years, whether they admit it or not.”</p>

<p>“Then you have no sign of a clue?” The inspector’s
face lengthened. “If we don’t clean this case up in record
time the papers will let out a roar that we’re lying down
on the job because Hughes wasn’t a person of prominence,
and with election so near the commissioner’ll be up on
his toes to show results. It’s of more importance now
for us to find out who killed that valet than if he were
a king!”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> the inspector had left them McCarty and
Dennis mounted to the apartment above and
together looked over the bank-book and check-book appropriated
from beneath the rug in Hughes’ room.</p>

<p>The first showed a regular deposit of one hundred and
fifty dollars on the first of every month with varying sums
between, ranging from twenty to just under a hundred,
but balanced it invariably revealed only a comparatively
small amount on hand.</p>

<p>“If the one hundred and fifty means his wages, he got
mighty high ones,” Dennis remarked. “Still, Orbit
looks like the kind who’d pay anything if he was suited
and he said Hughes was a perfect valet, if you remember.
The money deposited during the month might be his winnings
at the races or cards and he was a lucky son-of-a-gun,
but he seems to have lived up to nearly every cent.”</p>

<p>“Or lost it back again,” suggested McCarty. “Let’s
have a look at the check-book.”</p>

<p>The stubs in the latter were not illuminating, for the
dead man had evidently evolved a method of his own
for noting those to whom he assigned checks and only
hieroglyphics designated them. Laying aside this disappointing
record McCarty turned to the little pile of letters
which he had taken from the drawer of Hughes’
dresser and passed a handful to his companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Here, Denny, sort these,” he directed. “You can tell
by the writing if not by the names signed to them. If
they’re love letters from women the more fools they, and
’tis no time to be squeamish!”</p>

<p>For a brief space there was silence, except for the rustle
of paper and an occasional shocked exclamation from
the scandalized Dennis, but at last he glanced up with a
look of wonderment and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Don’t it beat hell how much alike they are, all of
them?”</p>

<p>“Who are?” McCarty asked absently.</p>

<p>“Women!” Dennis waved a huge paw in a vaguely
comprehensive gesture. “American or foreign,—and you
can tell the last by the strange words they put in when
they can’t think of the English of them,—they all begin
writing to him as if they was doing him a favor, the
scoundrel! After a bit they start bossing him, and nagging
and fault-finding, then they throw a bluff at ‘good-by
forever,’ and the last of it’s always the same; begging
him to come back! ’Tis well for us, Mac, that we’ve
steered clear of them, for the both of us would have been
wax in their hands!”</p>

<p>“Speak for yourself!” McCarty retorted. “No living
woman could make a mark of me, though I’m giving none
a chance! ’Tis funny they’d fall for a beefy, middle-aged
guy like that, though, with the little mean eyes of
him and the bald spot and all!”</p>

<p>“There’s no telling what they’ll take to!” asserted Dennis
darkly. “There’s only one sensible female in the lot
here; this one signing herself ‘Truda.’ She tells him
kind but firm to stop writing to her or it’ll bring trouble
to the two of them and it’s all damn’ foolishness, anyway.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“She said that?” demanded McCarty.</p>

<p>“Not in those words, maybe; I’ve put it shorter and
better than she does,” Dennis admitted modestly. “It
looks as if she goes out sick-nursing or something, but
she’s a married woman, all right.”</p>

<p>“‘Married?’” McCarty dropped the letter he had just
taken up. “‘Truda’ might stand for ‘Gertrude,’ and
‘Gertie’ is short for the same name. I wonder now could
she be ‘Gertie’?”</p>

<p>“And who in the world is Gertie?” Dennis stared.
“Have you been holding out on me, Mac?”</p>

<p>“I have not. Snape told the inspector this morning
that Hughes was crazy over some married woman named
Gertie, but that’s all he knew about her. Read the letters,
Denny.”</p>

<p>“There’s only two of them.” Dennis spread out the
thin, double sheet of folded note-paper. “Listen, then:
this is the first, for ’tis dated August twenty-second.—‘Dear
friend Alfred. I was surprised and very pleased
with the so pretty flowers you send to me, but please, you
should not do it any more. I no longer am a girl, that I
could accept such things and also he would be so angry
to know. He is still there but you have not seen him for
some days because the old gentleman of whom he takes
care has been much worser. To me he has not come, even,
but soon he will and my lady always talks to him when
she is well enough, she takes interest for him to learn
English more quicker. I got fear she speaks to him of the
pretty flowers, for I tell her they come from him, and so
it makes troubles for you and me, the both. Because of
that, though I thank you for the so kind thought, I ask
that you send no more. Your very true friend, Truda.’”</p>

<p>“Humph! Truda ain’t so strong on the English herself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
is she?” McCarty remarked. “Sounds like a Dutch
girl to me, or one of those squareheads. I wonder where
her husband could be working that Hughes expected to
see him? Anyway, it’s him and not her does the sick-nursing,
Denny.”</p>

<p>“The both of them do!” Dennis declared. “Wait’ll you
hear the second letter.—‘Dear friend. I could not meet
you as you wish for my lady is not so well and I do not
leave her bed, but also I would not. It is much silliness
that you write me and you should not do it again once.
You are making yourself amused with me and I got anger
you should keep sending the letters I do not want and that
could harm us both yet. He is not stupid and mild like
you think. Nothing he says but much he thinks, and then
it comes out and terrible is it. So you will not write
again, nor try that I should see you. Your friend,
Truda.’”</p>

<p>“She’s Dutch, all right, and level-headed. Hughes
must have had the fine opinion of himself as a lady-killer,
to be chasing after a respectable married woman
that wanted nothing to do with the likes of him!” McCarty
snorted. “I’ll bet Snape knows who she is and
the husband, too, only he’s scared to speak now.”</p>

<p>“Mac, do you mind what Orbit told us about that
Calabar bean being used as a medicine? Besides a doctor,
who’d know more about medicines and poisons and
such than a trained nurse?” Dennis’ leathery countenance
was flushed with sudden excitement. “Hughes
thought Truda’s husband was a dull-witted lout, with no
more spirit than a sick cat, but <em>she</em> says he’s terrible when
he gets going, and she’d ought to know! What if he
got on to them letters and being a foreigner with little
or no English—!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“Denny!” McCarty gazed wide-eyed at his confrère.
“By the powers, I wonder if you’ve hit it! If Snape’s
held anything back he’ll come across with it now! Are
you sure there are no more ‘Truda’ letters except the
two?”</p>

<p>“Not here, but you’ve not gone through all yours yet.”
Dennis reminded him.</p>

<p>McCarty fell upon the few that remained and running
hastily over them seized on one with an exclamation
of satisfaction. It died upon his lips as he ran his eye
down the page and then glanced up at Dennis’ tense
face.</p>

<p>“Listen you to this!” he said impressively. “’Tis short
but tells more than the other two put together.—‘Friend
Alfred Hughes. To you I have tried to be kind but
it is not good. Now I say that if you should write again
I shall tell it to my husband that you are made to stop.
He knows already you bother me, but comes any more
letters and he will the street go over to make of you
sausage meat. It is enough. Truda L.’—And ’tis dated
just four days ago! Do you get it, Denny?”</p>

<p>“Only that the husband works near, but we learned
that much before—”</p>

<p>“‘Near?’” McCarty interrupted. “He’s across the
street! Didn’t Sloane say his old father was an invalid
with a male nurse that was a Swede and spoke little
English? Come on! It’s back we’ll be going to the New
Queen’s Mall!”</p>

<p>Dennis was overwhelmed with the importance of their
discovery and ventured only one question when they
stood again at the entrance gate.</p>

<p>“How’ll we start in on him?”</p>

<p>“On who?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“The Swede at Sloane’s. We’ll have to find out first if
his last name begins with ‘L.’”</p>

<p>“I’m not going near him, not till I’ve found and talked
to this Truda. It’s Snape I’m after and I’ll be leaving
you outside the gate, Denny, for maybe you’ll be scraping
acquaintance with him to-morrow, after all.”</p>

<p>Bill Jennings admitted him and stopped for a word
with Dennis, while McCarty went quickly to the Bellamy
house and rang the bell. The door was opened promptly
by a tall, slenderly erect man of thirty-five or a trifle more,
with the strongly marked features and intelligent, self-contained
expression of an actor. The slight puffiness
about the slate-gray eyes and fine lines at the corners of his
mouth were the only evidences of the possible dissipation
of which the watchman Jennings had spoken. He waited
with an aloof but courteous air of inquiry to learn the
visitor’s errand.</p>

<p>“You’re the butler here? Snape is your name?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” the man replied with no hint of surprise in
his tone but his eyes narrowed and a certain touch of
deference vanished from his manner.</p>

<p>“I’m a special deputy, headquarters.” McCarty showed
the old badge which he had resurrected just before leaving
his rooms with Dennis. “Inspector Druet thought you
forgot one or two things this morning that you might have
had time to remember by now. Where can we talk
private?”</p>

<p>Snape hesitated for a minute and then stepped aside
for McCarty to enter.</p>

<p>“Come this way.” He closed the door, and, turning,
started down the hall toward the rear, with McCarty at
his heels. The butler led his unwelcome guest through a
door opening into the domestic quarters of the establishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
and to a plainly but comfortably appointed dining-room
where he motioned to a chair at the table and seated
himself in another opposite.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you?” His tone was brisk but not
truculent, and McCarty, too, came to the point without
preamble.</p>

<p>“You can tell me the address where Truda’s working
now, taking care of the sick woman.”</p>

<p>“‘Truda?’” Snape frowned, as though perplexed, and
McCarty assumed an air of impatience.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know her! ‘Gertie,’ Hughes may have called
her to you, but Truda is the name she signs to her letters
and she mentions you in them.”</p>

<p>“Me?” Snape smiled incredulously. “There’s a mistake
somewhere. I don’t know any one by either name.”</p>

<p>“You spoke of her first to the inspector this morning.”</p>

<p>“I said Hughes had mentioned a girl named Gertie that
he was taken with, in a manner of speaking, but I didn’t
know anything more about her except just the name,
though from what he said I had a notion that she was
a married party.” Snape coughed discreetly. “I told the
inspector Hughes and I had a bit of diversion together
now and then, but nothing to do with women. He was
always running after one or another of them and I never
paid much attention to what he told me about them, but
in the case of this ‘Gertie’ he did say there was somebody
in the way, and I supposed he meant a husband.”</p>

<p>“You know well there was a husband and you’d not
need the strength of a child to throw a stone right now
and hit him!” McCarty retorted. “She’s respectable, with
no use for Hughes and his nonsense, and it was to save
her trouble, since he’s dead and out of it, that I came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
you for her address instead of going across the street
and giving her away to the man she’s married to. Of
course, if you can’t recall Hughes mentioning it to you
I’ve no choice.”</p>

<p>He made as if to rise and Snape wet his thin lips
nervously.</p>

<p>“I have my place to consider.” There was a slight
whine in his tone. “How do I know that the ‘Truda’ you
speak of is the same—!”</p>

<p>“Come across if you’re going to!” McCarty interrupted
with the harsh, commanding bark of the old days. “You
know damn’ well that if I go over to the Sloanes’ and
tell her husband ’twas you first wised us up that Hughes
and his wife—”</p>

<p>“I never said Otto Lindholm’s wife was the woman
Hughes was taken with!” A sullen note had replaced the
whine. “I said it was somebody named ‘Gertie’ and there
could be a million Gerties! The one he knew might be
companion to an invalid up on the Drive; a Mrs. Cochrane,
who has a private house in the neighborhood of
Eightieth Street, somewhere, but it’s not for me to say.
Hughes talked about so many—”</p>

<p>He paused with a shrug and McCarty asked quickly:</p>

<p>“When was the last time you saw Otto Lindholm?”</p>

<p>“The night before last—Thursday,—about eleven
o’clock. We met at the east gate coming in.”</p>

<p>“What did he have to say to you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. He’s too thick-headed to learn English
and he don’t say two words to anybody.” Snape
spoke with lazy contempt, but there was an undercurrent
of antagonism which McCarty recognized.</p>

<p>“He had a few words with you, though, didn’t he?
What are you and him on bad terms about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t even know him, except to nod to when we
meet!” Snape disclaimed. “He’s a surly customer and
never had any use for Hughes even before—”</p>

<p>He checked himself but it was too late.</p>

<p>“Before Thursday night, eh? So Hughes was with
you when you met outside the gate?” McCarty pounced
on him like a flash. “What passed between the three of
you? I want every word.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, Lindholm just said ‘hello’ to me and then
he stepped up to Hughes and growled something about letting
his wife alone or he’d fix him. That’s all I know, I
can’t repeat his lingo. Hughes blustered it out and Lindholm
went on in ahead of us muttering to himself, when
Dave Hollis opened the gate. I didn’t want to say anything
about it, because of getting the woman into trouble,
but what’s all this got to do with Hughes’ death?” The
gray eyes lighted shrewdly. “You fellows think there
was something wrong or you wouldn’t be raising all this
row over it. Nobody had it in for him bad enough to do
him any hurt, and the papers said nothing about his having
been beat up! You don’t think he was murdered,
do you?”</p>

<p>The amused insolence in the man’s voice was only
slightly veiled. McCarty concluded that if he were putting
it on he was indeed a smooth proposition, as the inspector
had said.</p>

<p>“Nobody beat him up.” He ignored the final question.
“Do you know any of the other help over at the
Sloanes’?”</p>

<p>“Only John Platt, the butler, but he’s old and hardly
leaves the house.” Snape had risen with alacrity, but as
he showed McCarty to the front door he added anxiously:
“I never even saw the Lindholm woman but once, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
don’t know what you want her for, but I hope you won’t
say that I tipped you off about her! I don’t want to get in
any mix-up with that Swede husband of hers and it would
be as much as my place is worth, if I was thought to have
made trouble in the Mall here!”</p>

<p>On the sidewalk before the house McCarty found an
exceedingly pretty young girl in the picturesque dress of
the typical French bonne, guiding the steps of a tiny, toddling
baby. The child was dimpling and gurgling with
mischief. Snatching suddenly at her nurse’s handbag she
tossed it as far out on the sidewalk as she could. McCarty
retrieved and returned it with a bow.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci, monsieur</i>,” the girl said gravely, but her dark
eyes too danced with laughter. “She is a very naughty,
bad baby that I have here, is it not so?”</p>

<p>The last observation was evidently intended for her
charge, but McCarty replied gallantly:</p>

<p>“’Twas a pleasure, miss! Sure, at that age they’re all
full of the—of life. It’s Mrs. Bellamy’s little girl, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur.” Her eyes were serious now and
there was a note of reserve in her soft voice. “Come, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma
petite</i>. We shall go in now.”</p>

<p>Dennis was waiting patiently and evinced considerable
interest in the brief tête-à-tête he had just witnessed, but
McCarty was not in a mood to be treated with levity.</p>

<p>“She’s a pretty girl and a polite one, but well you know
I’ve no eye for them!” he disclaimed. “I’ll be taking you
now to call on another, though, that’ll maybe give us some
real dope.”</p>

<p>“It’s Truda!” exulted Dennis. “You’ve made him
come across with her address! Did you get anything else
out of him, Mac?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“Only that there was bad blood between her husband,
that nurses at the Sloanes’, and Hughes.” McCarty repeated
the tale of the encounter and his companion’s face
expressed satisfaction.</p>

<p>“’Twill be him, all right!” he predicted sagely. “Them
silent, slow-thinking fellows are the worst! Where’d he
get hold of that Calabar bean stuff and how’d he slip
it to Hughes?”</p>

<p>“And why didn’t I go and pinch him right off the bat
instead of taking this little trip?” McCarty supplemented
sarcastically, as they boarded an uptown car. “There’s
more than him and that wall-eyed Chink that had it in for
Hughes, but we’ll see what his wife has to say.”</p>

<p>A telephone book, in a drugstore on Eightieth Street,
vouchsafed them the house number of the only Cochranes
on Riverside Drive. They found the place to be a small,
solidly built residence of gray stone with potted evergreens
flanking the turn of the steps to the entrance door.</p>

<p>A trim little maid with a coquettishly frilled apron admitted
them to a foyer, arranged informally as a library
or den, with seats built in at either side of the empty
hearth and books ranged along the opposite wall behind
a long table. There she left them and presently slow, soft
footsteps sounded on the stairs and another woman appeared.</p>

<p>She was thirty or thereabout, with thick braids of
coarse, pale-gold hair wound around a small, shapely
head, and a face whose perfect features would have rendered
it beautiful had it been lighted with intelligence;
but the great blue eyes were dull and bovine, and, although
the rich color came and went in her cheeks, there was
no hint of expression beyond vaguely bewildered inquiry
as she bowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“I am Mrs. Lindholm. The maid say that you wish
to see me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.” Dennis was gaping in flagrant admiration
at the vision, but McCarty stepped forward.
“We’ve come to return something that belongs to you.”</p>

<p>He handed her the first two letters which she had
written to the dead man and watched her face as she
recognized them. A shadow of dismay darkened her
eyes and a little frown gathered above them.</p>

<p>“Oh, for why did he keep them?” Her tone was distressed
but without agitation. “Such a nuisance as he
was, poor man! Where did you get these?”</p>

<p>“Amongst his things.” McCarty drew a step nearer.
“You know he is dead then?”</p>

<p>“Alfred Hughes? Yes, this morning in the papers I
see it. So sudden it was! You are his friends, maybe?”
She folded the letters and slipped them into the belt
of her starched, white nurse’s uniform. “Sit down, please.
I cannot long stay away from my patient.”</p>

<p>“We’re taking charge of Alfred Hughes’ belongings
and arranging with Mr. Orbit for the funeral.” McCarty
explained speciously, as they complied. “You and him
were good friends, weren’t you?”</p>

<p>Truda Lindholm shook her blonde head slowly.</p>

<p>“No. I meet him by accident when I go to see my
husband, who works across the street from Mr. Orbit’s,
and then he waits for me two—three times. If you have
read these letters you must know he gets a foolishness in
his mind to make a flirtation with me, but it did not please
me. He is gone now, poor soul, and so we do not talk
about that, no?”</p>

<p>“But you did talk about it, didn’t you, Mrs. Lindholm?”
asked McCarty. “You told your husband?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it is right that I tell <em>him</em>.” Her eyes opened
wider, but there was no trace of confusion in her tone.
“Already I told him that Alfred Hughes followed me,
and once he and that friend of his who works next door,
they want I should go to a dance with them. Such a nonsense,
a married woman! I think it is joost silly but
Otto is angry and so I do not tell him any more.”</p>

<p>She spoke with the naïve candor of a child. McCarty
continued:</p>

<p>“You did tell him when Hughes wouldn’t stop writing
to you, though. When did you see your husband last,
Mrs. Lindholm? Thursday evening, was it?”</p>

<p>“Thursday, yes. It is then I tell him. I am tired that
I should be bothered and I think he shall speak to Alfred
Hughes, but now I am sorry.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Dennis found his voice all at once, and the
woman turned a glance of calm wonder upon him.</p>

<p>“That my Otto should be for nothing worried? So
much to heart he takes things, and now it makes no difference.
You do not think, please, that I am without
feeling about the so unfortunate death of your friend. It
makes me shocked and sad to read of it, but death is always
sad. Thank you much for my letters, it was a
foolishness that they were not sooner destroyed.—And
now I must go to Mrs. Cochrane. You will excuse
me?”</p>

<p>She rose, and Dennis and McCarty followed suit, but
the latter shook his head.</p>

<p>“Just a minute, ma’am. Was it here you saw your
husband on Thursday?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he came to see me. But what is this? Why do
you ask?” Surprise raised her rather flat tones a note or
two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“Because I want to know just what passed between you
two about our friend Alfred Hughes.” McCarty responded
doggedly. “Have you heard from your husband
since?”</p>

<p>“He telephoned to me yesterday.” The color ebbed
slowly from her cheeks, then swept back in a deep flood
and she clasped her hands. “Oh, do you mean that there
was trouble between them? A quarrel? Ach, such a
pity! Otto comes to me about nine o’clock Thursday
night. Two days before I have still another letter received
from your friend asking that I should meet him
and I am angry; I write to him that I shall tell my husband
and so I do when he comes, for I still got anger.
Otto, he gets a worser mad on and he wants he should go
then to Alfred Hughes, but I say to wait, maybe comes
no more letters and then there is no troubles. From
Bavaria I come but my husband is Swedish and such a
temper he has! Sometimes I think I do not know him
and six years I am married already! We say no more
of Alfred Hughes and I think Otto has forgotten—did
he go yet and make bad friends with him?”</p>

<p>“I guess they had some words, ma’am, but it don’t
matter now as you say.” McCarty was watching her
with a feeling of growing wonder on his own account.
Could the woman be as stupid as she seemed? Hughes
had evidently been less than nothing to her, she was apparently
devoted to her husband and still—in McCarty’s
own mental phraseology—giving him a blacker eye every
time she opened her mouth.</p>

<p>“But it is bad luck that one should be unfriends with
the dead!” She shook her head and made a little clucking
noise with her teeth. “The fault is mine that I
should so quickly have spoken, for Alfred Hughes got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
only the foolishness in his head to make a joke; not a
bad man was he!”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s done with now and that’s the end of it.”
McCarty signaled to his colleague with a quick glance.
“We won’t be keeping you any longer from your patient.
Is it a very hard case you’ve got?”</p>

<p>“It is the nerves and heart.” A still gentler note crept
into the dull tones. “Mrs. Cochrane has got much sorrow;
her little boy she has lost less than a month ago.”</p>

<p>“Too bad!” McCarty sympathized absent-mindedly.
“What did he die of?”</p>

<p>“Of tetanus.”</p>

<p>Dennis started.</p>

<p>“Is it catching?” he asked nervously. “Could you get
it after?”</p>

<p>A little smile dimpled Truda Lindholm’s smooth cheek.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Comes it from the scratch of a rusty nail,
sometimes, and causes the jaws to set rigid, to lock.”</p>

<p>“Lockjaw!” Dennis stared for a moment and then
his own lower jaw snapped. “Come along, Mac! There’s
a date we’ll be missing!”</p>

<span class="fs80">GATES OF MYSTERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">They</span> argued hotly all the way back to the New
Queen’s Mall, Dennis convinced that his prediction
was already verified and McCarty combating the idea
from force of habit as much as from any other urge, although
he felt that the indications were too vague as yet,
the clues too tenuous, to be woven into a fabric of proof.</p>

<p>“What’s it that this Otto had a few words with him?”
he demanded as they reached the west gate on the Avenue.
“Ching Lee went further than that with a knife! Because
Truda is working now in a house where a child
died of the lockjaw, and Calabar bean is one of the cures
they try for it, you’ve got it all fixed that Otto laid hold of
some of it there, or Truda gave it to him, and he must
needs have gone over the way and sprinkled enough of it
on Hughes’ dinner, unbeknownst to any one, to kill him!
’Tis well you took to fire-fighting, Denny, instead of following
me on the Force!”</p>

<p>“Is it so!” Dennis retorted. “I’m still on my job, let
me remind you, though maybe ’tis well you resigned when
you did, if you can’t see further than the end of your own
nose, that you couldn’t even smell with last night! Who
else on the block has been within a mile of a case of
lockjaw, and for what else would that powdered bean
be left lying around? Swede or Chink, a man’s a man,
though you might pick up a knife or a blackthorn, whichever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
was handiest, to go for a bully you saw abusing a
kid it would be in hot rage; ’twould take something bigger
than that to make you sit down, cool and calm, and figure
out how to poison him! But a jealous husband might,
and didn’t Otto threaten to ‘fix’ Hughes, by the words
out of Snape’s mouth? That Truda don’t suspicion a
thing, but then she’d not know it if a powder factory
took fire next door! ’Tis a crime of nature that such a
grand-looking woman should be so dumb!”</p>

<p>“We’ve another kind of a crime on our hands, I’d
remind you,” McCarty observed. “Where on earth is
that Bill Jennings?”</p>

<p>He rang once more and Dennis pointed through the
grill-work of the fence.</p>

<p>“There he is, clear at the other end of the block, letting
another guy out of the east gate. They’ve walled themselves
in fine, the folks that live here, but they could
not shut out age, nor sickness, nor murder! Good-afternoon,
sir!”</p>

<p>Immaculate in frock coat and tall silk hat, the elder of
the two Sloanes, whom they had encountered on the previous
evening, had swung briskly down the Avenue to
their side. He appeared, for the moment, oblivious to
Dennis’ salutation, as he fumbled with his gold pince-nez
and stared down the vista of the enclosed street.</p>

<p>“Confound it! What’s the fellow mean—?” Then
he drew himself up and turned to the couple near. “Oh,
you’re the men from Headquarters! Still on that affair
of Orbit’s valet?—I’ve forgotten my key again; such a
bore!”</p>

<p>“There, the watchman’s seen us; he’s coming on the
run.” McCarty nudged his companion and then added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
to Gardner Sloane: “We’ve been talking to the other
servants on the block, but we haven’t been to your house
yet since you said only your butler and the trained nurse
would be likely to have known Hughes.”</p>

<p>“Unless I’m mistaken that was Lindholm the nurse
going out the other gate just now!” Sloane fumed.
“Wretched impudence, his leaving my father like this
without permission. It always gives him a bad turn
to be left alone. But what’s all this to do about the
valet’s death? Nothing actually suspicious about it, was
there? Silly rot, having an investigation of this sort in
the Mall!”</p>

<p>Bill Jennings pounded heavily up and admitted them at
this juncture, preventing the necessity of a reply from
McCarty, who was carefully avoiding Dennis’ stare of
dismayed inquiry.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, that was Otto Lindholm,” the watchman answered
Sloane’s irascible query. “He remarked to me
that he was called away sudden for a few days.”</p>

<p>“I am not interested in his remarks! He shall be dismissed
for this!” Sloane strode off angrily, without taking
further notice of the two who had followed him, and
Dennis plucked McCarty’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“We’ve lost him!” he exclaimed disconsolately. “That
wife of his may not have been so dumb, after all, if
she’s ’phoned and put him wise!”</p>

<p>“Let be!” McCarty cautioned: “Bill, did Lindholm
say where he was going? He must have been called away
mighty quick, for we had a kind of a date with him.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say, but he looked more glum than usual;
seemed in a hurry, too.” Bill turned and then waited as
they did not advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it’s no matter, anyway. We were to pick up
the inspector but I guess he’s gone on downtown. We’ll
be beating it ourselves, Denny.”</p>

<p>Outside the gates once more, Dennis observed:</p>

<p>“Likely the woman’s gone, too, and it’s near six. I’ll
have to be getting back to the fire-house to report, but
you’ll let me know if you locate them? No matter when
or how he contrived to dose Hughes with that poison it
must have been Lindholm, for his skipping out proves
it! To think of them two dumb-bells, the man and the
woman, being at the bottom of it!”</p>

<p>McCarty shook his head.</p>

<p>“’Twas not a crime of brawn, Denny, but of brains,
and I’m thinking the one clever enough to plan it would
be too farseeing to run away before he’d real reason. I’ll
drop ’round to-morrow morning if there’s any news.”</p>

<p>On the west side of the park they separated, Dennis to
take up his duty and McCarty to return to the Cochrane
house. As the former had predicted, Truda Lindholm had
departed hurriedly half an hour before, after a telephone
conversation during which she had learned of serious
illness in her own family. The same trim maid who
opened the door at their first visit was McCarty’s informant
and she couldn’t say from whom the message
had come, but she added that Mrs. Lindholm seemed more
distressed at leaving her patient than anxious over her
own trouble. She had been there nearly a month, since
just after Mrs. Cochrane’s little boy died, and had come
well recommended from the West End registry for
nurses; they had all liked her.</p>

<p>At the registry office McCarty obtained an address in
the Bronx, only to learn from the Swedish couple living
there that Mr. and Mrs. Lindholm had boarded with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
them up to a month before, but had left, giving the
Sloane house as a forwarding address.</p>

<p>He ate a solitary dinner and then returned to his rooms,
to meditate disgustedly over the negative result of the
day’s efforts. Hughes’ murder challenged his every instinct
and habit of mind. If Ching Lee knew nothing
of it, what impulse had taken him that morning to the
scene of the crime’s consummation? Were Lindholm and
his wife both stupid enough to have taken alarm at the
first hint of investigation, if they were innocent, and so
deserted their responsible positions? Had Snape really
told all he knew?</p>

<p>McCarty chewed savagely on his unlighted cigar, as
he paced back and forth. How would the bright lads in
the new scientific school of criminal psychology down at
headquarters get after the mystery? With a concrete
example before him, would those books he had vainly
pored over give him a hint now? Dubiously he resurrected
his newly-acquired collection from the depths of
his closet and then paused at sight of the pale blue covered
pamphlet protruding from the pocket of the coat hanging
above. It was the book he had appropriated from
Orbit’s library the night before, because it seemed to
have something about psychology in it that a fellow
could get through his head. Now he sat himself down
doggedly to study it, with his own library scattered about
him.</p>

<p>It was dawn before he went to bed at last, with the
unaltered conviction that this new school was not for
him and that if he were to succeed at all it must be by
the wits God gave him, which, he had once told Dennis,
were his only science.</p>

<p>Yet Sunday passed and Monday; Hughes was laid to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
rest in the grave provided for him by his late employer,
and still there was no inkling of his murderer’s identity.
Ching Lee blandly declared he had been to Chinatown
on the morning after the tragedy and offered to produce
numerous relations to prove it. No slightest trace could
be found of the Lindholms; and Snape kept sedulously
to the Bellamy house, affording Dennis no opportunity
to foster an acquaintance. The newspapers were already
criticizing the police department, Inspector Druet smarted
under the recriminations from higher up, and Dennis
lugubriously predicted defeat.</p>

<p>“The truth of it will never come out, Mac, with them
Lindholms disappearing and all,” he remarked on Tuesday
afternoon, as they walked slowly down the Mall
toward Orbit’s house. “Maybe if we could get a line on
Hughes’ actions from the time he left here and the way
he took down to where he died—?”</p>

<p>“I’ve taken a dozen different routes trying to get
trace of somebody who might have noticed him when
he first took sick to see did he give a hint to them of what
he was wanting to say when the end came, but ’tis no
matter of use,” McCarty interrupted gloomily. “You
said the first night we set foot in here that ’twould be
small mystery could last for long between these two
gates and yet it’s within a space where you could swing
a cat that the answer lies; that’s what gets my goat! I
want to have another talk with Orbit. He’s late getting
in his coal, ain’t he?”</p>

<p>The roar of coal sliding down a chute from a huge
truck beside the door almost drowned his comment, but
Dennis nodded.</p>

<p>“Look at them two guys working like blazes shoving
it down the hole quicker, and Jean waiting with the hose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
to clean the sidewalk after.” He pointed. “Orbit must
be going to give some sort of a shindy, for isn’t that a
red carpet and an awning piled up alongside the door?
You’ll be out of luck if you’re wanting to interview him
again this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“No. There he is up in the window of his own private
sitting-room, so don’t be pointing, Denny! He’s doing
something to the flowers.”</p>

<p>By daylight the front of the classic white marble house
was a blaze of gorgeous color from the window boxes on
each sill filled with blooms of vivid but perfectly blended
hue, with graceful vines trailing in slender, artfully
trained tendrils down over the gleaming walls.</p>

<p>In one of the windows on the second floor the tall
figure of Henry Orbit appeared, the delicate touch of
silver in his dark hair plainly visible as he bent forward,
and when he caught sight of the two below he inclined
his head in dignified but amicable greeting.</p>

<p>“We’ll go to him now?” Denny asked.</p>

<p>“After we stroll down to the other gate and back.
Did it strike you that there’s no sign of Bill Jennings on
the block?” At the insistence of the inspector they had
been temporarily provided with a key to the Mall, rendering
them independent of the offices of either day or night
watchman, but until now they had invariably encountered
one or the other of these guardians.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s having a bit of a chat with a maid in one
of the houses,” Dennis suggested helpfully. “There’s
small blame to him, for it must be mortal tiresome—”</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if the gate was open.” McCarty
insensibly quickened his steps. “Come on, I want to
see.”</p>

<p>The gate was swinging slightly ajar, but the passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
pedestrians on Madison Avenue gave it no heed and the
delinquent watchman was nowhere in evidence.</p>

<p>“Let’s shut it.” Dennis turned to his companion.
“Bill’s a good fellow and there’s no need of getting him
into trouble with the lords of creation like that Sloane if
he’s just stepped out for a bit. He’ll have his own key
to let himself in and these gates are damn’ foolishness,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“He’s breaking a rule if not a law, Denny, and we’ve
no call to be condoning it for him.” McCarty’s years of
discipline returned to him. “We’ll be minding our own
business, and get back to Orbit’s now.”</p>

<p>“Bill can’t have gone far, knowing that coal-truck
will have to be let out in a few minutes,” Dennis averred.
“’Tis almost empty now and I’ll bet those guys got a
tip from Orbit, to be working that fast! He’s moved to
the other window now.”</p>

<p>Ching Lee admitted them, impassive as ever. Their
call was evidently anticipated, for he conducted them at
once up to the private study. Orbit turned from the
window with an inquiring glance and they saw that he
held in his hand an oddly-shaped, silver-mounted sprayer.</p>

<p>“Have you any news for me?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Nothing definite yet. But don’t let us bother you,
Mr. Orbit; I just wanted to ask you a question or two.”</p>

<p>“Glad to tell you anything, of course. I am just spraying
the flowers to rid them of any particles of coal dust
which may have floated up.” Orbit turned again to the
window as he spoke. “It is a pity that such a hideous
utilitarian necessity should mar their perfection, but the
truck is going now.”</p>

<p>The rumble of the heavy vehicle arose from below as he
spoke. Stepping to the other window, McCarty saw that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
the familiar figure of Bill Jennings was waiting once more
by the eastern gate which he had thrown wide.</p>

<p>“You’re having a party later, Mr. Orbit?”</p>

<p>“A musicale. Giambattista is to appear and my guests
will arrive in an hour. The unfortunate delay in putting
in the coal—but what did you wish to ask me? I would
have recalled the invitations if I could for I am in little
mood for a function; the mystery surrounding the death
of poor Hughes is more disturbing than anything I have
known for years and I am waiting anxiously for it to be
solved.”</p>

<p>He came forward again, replacing the sprayer in its
case, and seated himself in the chair beside his writing
table.</p>

<p>“Well, it was quite a bit of money Hughes left for a
fellow that threw it around like he did and the inspector
dropped a hint of it to the newspaper boys so if anybody
thought they could fake a claim they’d show themselves.
He wants to know if you’ve been approached?”</p>

<p>Dennis stared in amazement at this unexpected departure
but Orbit shook his head.</p>

<p>“I have heard nothing from any claimant in this country
or his own, but I have instructed my attorneys to cable
to Cornwall, not only for Hughes’ heirs but to ascertain if
any close relatives of his are in actual want. I feel that
it is the least I can do after twenty years of efficient
service.”</p>

<p>“You’ve not replaced him yet?”</p>

<p>Orbit shrugged.</p>

<p>“That would be well-nigh impossible to do. A new
man is coming in a few days, highly recommended by a
friend, but he will not be another Hughes.... What is
it, Ching Lee?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>He had taken a cigarette from an ivory box on the
table and he paused with it midway to his lips as the
butler appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>“The tutor, Mr. Trafford, sir. He desires to know if
Master Horace is here.”</p>

<p>“‘Here?’” Orbit raised his eyebrows. “No. I haven’t
seen the little chap since he passed this morning with
Mr. Trafford. You might ask Fu Moy or Jean if they
have seen him.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>

<p>Ching Lee inclined his head and departed, as silently
as he had come. Orbit lighted his cigarette and leaned
back.</p>

<p>“You’ve no definite clue yet, you say? None of
Hughes’ associates, whoever they may have been, can suggest
any reason for such a purposeless crime as this appears?”</p>

<p>“We’re looking for more of his associates, Mr. Orbit.
The gentlemen who’ve visited you here—the most of
them brought their own valets with them, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Naturally.” Orbit nodded and blew a smoke ring
thoughtfully into the air.</p>

<p>“Hughes may have grown thick with some of them,
though you’d not be likely to know of it. I’d like a list
as near as you can remember of the gentlemen who have
stayed here during the past year, say, so we can look
up their servants.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you offhand of several of my guests but it
will take more time than I can spare this afternoon to give
you a complete list, and frankly, it is distasteful to me to
have my friends annoyed.” Orbit’s tone was pleasant but
firm. “The latest to visit me, whom I can recall, are
Professor Harrowden, from the Smithsonian Institute,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Sir Philip Devereux and Conan Fairclough of London,
Sabatiano Maura, Yareslow Gazdik—”</p>

<p>“Mr. Orbit, would you write the last two?” McCarty interrupted
earnestly. “Where might Professor Harrowden
be found?”</p>

<p>“In South America just now, leading an expedition up
the Amazon.” Orbit laid his cigarette in a tray of curiously
hammered red gold and reached obligingly for a
pen. “Fairclough’s off for Africa again, I believe, and
Gazdik is playing a series of concerts at Biarritz.”</p>

<p>“Are the others at the ends of the earth, too?” The
question was bland, but McCarty’s smile was a trifle
grim.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” Orbit smiled also in understanding, as he
rose and offered the sheet of paper. “Sir Philip is on
his way here from the West to visit me again for a
few days and Maura’s portrait exhibition closes in Philadelphia
before the end of the month when he, too, will
return before sailing again for Madrid. I’ll send the
complete list to headquarters for you, but I’m afraid you
won’t find that their menservants learned much of
Hughes’ affairs in the brief time they were here.”</p>

<p>McCarty thanked him and they took their departure, encountering
Ching Lee in the hall below who showed them
out in silence.</p>

<p>“’Tis beyond me what you got out of that interview,”
Dennis declared. “Stalling, is what I’d have called
it!”</p>

<p>“The two of us!” McCarty agreed with a chuckle.
“Him as well as me. He’ll not be dragging his friends
into this business if he can help it!... Who’s the lanky,
worried-looking guy talking to Bill?”</p>

<p>Halfway down the block, a tall, thin, bespectacled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
young man was gesticulating nervously as he confronted
the watchman whose vehement shakes of the head denoted
protestation. While they watched, the young man turned
abruptly and made for the Goddard house. Bill advanced
slowly toward them.</p>

<p>“Have you fellows seen the Goddard boy?” he asked.
“He’s the red-headed kid you saw me let in the first day
you came. That was his private teacher who’s been looking
for him for an hour but he didn’t go out either of the
gates.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he did awhile back when that one was left
open,” McCarty suggested dryly.</p>

<p>“Good Lord, did you know that!” Bill gasped. “If you
let on it’ll cost me my job, and I only stepped ’round the
corner for a smoke! The kid’s all right, but they treat
him like a baby. Did you find out yet who killed
Hughes?”</p>

<p>“We’re waiting for news every minute,” McCarty assured
him gravely as they reached the western gate. “I
shouldn’t wonder if it came to-night.”</p>

<p>“Now what in the world did you give him that bunk
for?” demanded Dennis, when they had left the Mall
safely behind them.</p>

<p>“I said ‘news,’ but not of what kind, Denny,” replied
his companion with dignity. “You’re not on duty till
morning?”</p>

<p>“No, I was thinking I’d drop in at Molly’s, now the
kid has got over the measles.”</p>

<p>“Well, come to my rooms when you leave your sister’s,”
McCarty invited. “I’ve accepted a bribe from one of
my Homevale tenants, who’s law-breaking in his cellar,
and if you’re not afraid of being poisoned like
Hughes——?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll be there!” Dennis promised with alacrity.</p>

<p>He was as good as his word but when he arrived no
refreshment awaited him. Instead, McCarty turned from
the telephone with a glint of latent excitement in his blue
eyes and announced:</p>

<p>“The news has come, Denny. Horace Goddard has
been kidnapped!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<span class="fs80">IN THIN AIR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“Glad</span> you could come at once, McCarty.” Eustace
Goddard’s ruddy face was pale, and the humorous
quirk beneath the ends of the small, sandy mustache had
given place to a tremulous droop. “Your inspector
thought I had some information for you about that valet’s
death when I telephoned headquarters to ask for your
address and I didn’t undeceive him. Don’t want any
notoriety about this while a shadow of doubt remains—but
God! I—I’m worried!”</p>

<p>“You’ll recall Special Deputy Riordan from that first
talk we had at Orbit’s?” McCarty indicated his colleague
who stood in the doorway. “You told me over the ’phone
that your boy had been kidnapped; he’s pretty big for
that, ain’t he, and in broad day?”</p>

<p>“What else can we think?” Goddard threw out his
arms in a helpless gesture. “Horry vanished in thin air
this afternoon! He hadn’t any idea of going out, in fact,
he complained of a headache after lunch—he has never
been very strong—and his mother left him curled up on
the couch in the library here when she went shopping.
She returned late to dress for Orbit’s musicale and didn’t
inquire for him, supposing him to be with Trafford, his
tutor. I reached home from the club about half-past five
and found Trafford very much disturbed—But here he
is! He’ll tell you himself. Mr. Trafford, these are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
men for whom I sent. Will you tell them when you
first missed Horry?”</p>

<p>The thin, anxious-looking, bespectacled young man,
whom they had seen in conversation with the watchman
that afternoon, came slowly forward.</p>

<p>“I went to the library at three to tell him it was time
for his Latin lesson,” he began, his voice dazed and
shaken. “He wasn’t there and I searched the house for
him, surprised that he should have gone out without mentioning
it. Then it occurred to me that he might have
slipped over to Mr. Orbit’s house next door, where there
is an exceptionally fine collection of paintings which fascinate
him. His ruling ambition is to become an artist and
Mr. Orbit has encouraged him—but I digress. I went
there to inquire for him but no one had seen him, and
then, really anxious, I questioned the watchman who assured
me that he had not gone out either gate.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” remarked McCarty as Dennis shuffled his feet
uneasily. “And what did you do after, Mr. Trafford?”</p>

<p>“I concluded that Horace had gone to see the artist who
has been instructing him in drawing and of whom he is
very fond; I could think of nothing else that would account
for his disappearance, but it seemed probable some
neighbor with a key to the Mall had entered just as he
left so that the watchman need not have been called upon
to open the gate for him.” The young man’s hands were
clenching and unclenching nervously and beads of moisture
stood out upon his forehead. “I therefore didn’t
mention it to Mrs. Goddard before she went to the musicale
but waited, believing Horace would return at any
moment. When the afternoon grew late I searched the
house again, questioned the servants, even went across
the street to inquire at the Sloane house for him; young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
Mr. Sloane has taken an interest also in his artistic efforts
and it is the only other house on the block he is
privileged to visit by himself, since the Burminsters are
still away. I—I met with no success!—If I had only
given the alarm earlier!”</p>

<p>He was turning away with a groan when McCarty
asked:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you think to ’phone Blaisdell and ask if
the lad had been there, Trafford?”</p>

<p>The wretched tutor stared and Goddard, who had been
standing with his elbows on the mantel and his head in his
hands, suddenly wheeled.</p>

<p>“How did you know Blaisdell is the artist who has been
giving him lessons?” he demanded.</p>

<p>McCarty smiled.</p>

<p>“I heard him say himself that Blaisdell was going on
a sketching tour next month and would take him, only
you wouldn’t hear of it,” he explained. “The boy was
wild to go along——”</p>

<p>“Mr. Blaisdell started yesterday,” the tutor interrupted.
“I learned this when I telephoned to his studio
this afternoon, as I did as soon as the idea occurred to
me that Horace might have gone there. I forgot to mention
it but my anxiety—! I feel criminally negligent in
having taken the situation so easily!”</p>

<p>“Don’t the boy ever get a chance to play with other
lads?” Dennis spoke for the first time, his tone filled with
pitying contempt. “Couldn’t he have gone to the Park
and then home to supper with one or another of
them?”</p>

<p>“My son does not play in the Park,” Goddard responded
with dignity. “He rides there with a class from the
Academy on two mornings of the week but the season<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
does not reopen until next month. Horace is delicate
as I told you and has never cared for rough, physical
exercise, although he is far from being a mollycoddle.
He has a few friends of his own age but they are all
still at their country homes; Mr. Trafford and I have
telephoned to every one we can think of! Mrs. Goddard
is prostrated and under the care of her physician;
when she returned from Orbit’s musicale and learned of
Horace’s disappearance she was almost beside herself.
He is our only child, you know. If anything has happened
to him—!”</p>

<p>He ran his hand violently through his scanty fringe of
hair and McCarty observed:</p>

<p>“’Tis queer the lad didn’t tell you himself that Blaisdell
was going away yesterday.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t talked of him very much lately.” Goddard
hesitated and then went on: “Horace is an unusual boy,
very sensitive and reserved. I don’t pretend to understand
him. He took it very much to heart when we declined
to allow him to go on this sketching tour but, of
course, it was out of the question; no one but an artist
would have suggested such an impractical thing for a boy
of his age, and with his frail constitution!—Damn that
dog! He’ll drive me out of my mind!”</p>

<p>A doleful, long-drawn howl, subdued but eloquent,
reached their ears from below-stairs and McCarty remembered
his brief talk with the boy in that very room three
days before.</p>

<p>“Is that Max, the police dog your son was telling me
about when I called here?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He wandered around whining until I couldn’t
stand it any longer and had him shut up. Devilish
clever animal and devoted to Horry—knows there’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
something wrong! By God, hear that! Midnight!
What can have happened to my boy?”</p>

<p>He dropped into a chair burying his face in his hands
as the clock struck and once more Dennis spoke.</p>

<p>“Have you any notion how much pocket money the
lad had this day?”</p>

<p>It was Trafford who replied to him.</p>

<p>“Six dollars and seventy-five cents. I am teaching
him to keep a budget and he carefully puts down whatever
he spends each day.”</p>

<p>“Little and red-headed, wasn’t he, with a narrow chest
and spindling legs—”</p>

<p>“Riordan means is he small for his age and kind of delicate
looking?” McCarty amended hastily, glaring at the
tactless interrogator. “How was he dressed when you
last saw him and what’s missing from his things?”</p>

<p>“He wore a brown pedestrian suit and brown shoes
and golf stockings,” the tutor answered. “He had a plain
platinum wrist watch on a leather strap and a gold seal
ring with the family coat of arms. Nothing else is missing
except a brown cloth cap with the manufacturer’s
name, ‘Knowles,’ inside. Before communicating with
you, Mr. Goddard and I telephoned to every hospital in
the city, fearing that some street accident might have
occurred, but no child whose appearance tallied in the
least degree with his had been brought in. The only remaining
possibility is that he is being detained somewhere
for a ransom.”</p>

<p>“Have you any other reason for thinking the lad may
have been kidnapped?” McCarty turned to Goddard.
“Know of anybody with a grudge against you or your
family? Had any threatening letters?”</p>

<p>“Great heavens, no!” The bereaved father raised his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
head. “Horry is a little chap for fourteen, looks nearer
twelve in fact, and Mr. Trafford usually accompanies him
when he leaves the Mall, but he begged so hard to go to
Blaisdell’s studio by himself that I allowed it, though it
was against his mother’s wishes; I wanted him to be
manly and self-reliant, and the Madison Avenue cars
pass Blaisdell’s door near Fiftieth. I thought it was
perfectly safe, but he may have been watched and marked
by some criminal as a victim for kidnapping.”</p>

<p>“That don’t explain how or why he passed out of one
gate or the other with not one on the whole block seeing
him.” McCarty shook his head. “You say you’re wishful
to avoid notoriety, or I’d advise you to report the
lad’s disappearance to the Bureau of Missing Persons
and let the investigation take its regular course, but
there’s a chance still that he’s not been kidnapped nor yet
met with an accident. ’Twas for Riordan and me to
try to locate him and get him back without having the
newspapers getting out extras that you sent for me to-night?”</p>

<p>Dennis caught his breath audibly at this highly irregular
supposition, but Goddard nodded eagerly.</p>

<p>“That’s it, exactly! It would kill Mrs. Goddard to
have the press make a sensational case of this while
there is the slightest hope that Horace may be restored
to us without publicity. You’ll do what you can? I’ll
pay anything, a fortune, to have my son again, safe!”</p>

<p>“We’ll do our best, Mr. Goddard,” McCarty rose.
“If we’ve no news for you by morning can we have a
word with Mrs. Goddard then?”</p>

<p>“Of course. I’d take you to her now, but the doctor
has given her something to quiet her. The servants
don’t know anything; I’ve questioned them till I’m hoarse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
and been in touch with every one to whom Horry might
have gone. For God’s sake, find my boy!”</p>

<p>Young Trafford showed them out and McCarty
glanced keenly into his pale, troubled face as he held the
door open. He seemed on the point of speech but
glanced back over his shoulder and then resolutely closed
his lips. McCarty paused.</p>

<p>“Before we come in the morning you’d do well to
tell the lad’s father to come clean with us,” he admonished
in a lowered tone. “’Tis not by keeping anything back
that he’ll help!”</p>

<p>Trafford started.</p>

<p>“Do you think he is?” he countered quickly. “I’ve
told you all I know, at any rate, but let me hear if there’s
anything more I can do. I’ll sit up all night by the
telephone.”</p>

<p>“Where are we going now?” Dennis asked as his companion
turned toward the east gate. “’Twas to find
who killed Hughes that the inspector made deputies of us,
not to be chasing runaway kids, but I’m trailing right
with you.”</p>

<p>“‘Runaway,’ is it? I thought that was your hunch
when you asked what pocket money the lad had and then
described him with more truth than politeness!” McCarty
chuckled. “You think he’s gone to join this artist fellow
Blaisdell? ’Twill be easy to settle that when we find out
where that tour was to commence, for Horace could not
have gone far on six seventy-five.”</p>

<p>“And we know how he got out all right,” Dennis supplemented.
“’Twas by that east gate ahead when Bill
left it open so convenient!—Look at Orbit’s house! Do
you suppose his afternoon party is lasting on through
the night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>The awning and carpet were still stretched from the
entrance door to curb, and, seemingly borne upon the subdued
radiance of the glow which filtered through the
curtained windows of the conservatory, there came to
them faintly the strains of the organ. It was no majestic
harmony this time, however, but a simple, insistently repetitive
measure. McCarty paused to listen, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>“Orbit’s by himself and just kind of thinking through
the organ; can’t you tell, the way he’s just wandering
along, amusing himself? That’s an easy little tune, too,
that would stick in your head.—Come on. I’ve a notion
to see part of this Mall we’ve not thought to examine yet.”</p>

<p>“If there’s a foot of it we’ve not been over, barring the
insides of the other houses—!” began Dennis in obvious
disappointment. “I thought we’d be getting after whoever
takes care of Blaisdell’s place to find where he’s
gone—”</p>

<p>“At this time of night?” snorted McCarty. “Has it
come to you that Goddard may not be so far wrong at
that, especially if he’s got some reason he hasn’t told for
thinking the lad was stolen? I’m beginning to see the
practical workings of those books of mine you turn your
nose up at and I ask you, did Horace look to have nerve
enough to run away? If he went outside these gates
it was of his own free will, of course, and during the time
Bill left the one of them open, but what if he’d been paid
to do it? What if the lad had been decoyed outside?
How do we know there’s not others on the block concerned
in it?”</p>

<p>“‘Others on the block!’” repeated Dennis, stopping
short as they passed the dark Bellamy house. “Mac!
You’re not thinking there could be any connection between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
what happened to Hughes four days ago and the
Goddard kid’s disappearance! You’re not looking to
have him found dead somewhere, poisoned! Glory be!
What’s come to this street all of a sudden?”</p>

<p>“I’m asking myself that,” returned the other grimly.
“I’m going no further in my mind, though, just saying
it looks funny, that’s all. Here’s a handful of rich
families living behind their gates in peace and seclusion
for generations, with nothing ever happening except
maybe a funeral now and then, for they could not shut
out death. Then a murder takes place right in their
midst, even if the victim did go far before he dropped in
his tracks, and while there’s still no answer to it somebody
in the next house disappears.”</p>

<p>“So that’s why you hinted at notoriety, if Goddard
took the case to headquarters instead of leaving it to us!
We’re still on the Hughes affair after all!” exclaimed
Dennis, adding: “What’s down here?”</p>

<p>McCarty had turned down the black passage or court
between Mrs. Bellamy’s and the closed Falkingham house
next door on the east, and he vouchsafed no response to
the companion who followed curiously at his heels until
they had reached the rear of the boarded-up residence.
Then he whispered cautiously:</p>

<p>“Got your flashlight?”</p>

<p>For answer Dennis produced the pocket electric torch
without which he seldom went on a nocturnal adventure
with McCarty. The latter took it from him, and, pressing
the button, darted a minute but piercing ray of light
along the rear of the houses whose front sidewalks they
had just traversed.</p>

<p>“See that, Denny?” he whispered. “An open court
as clear as the palm of your hand straight past the Bellamys’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
and Orbit’s to Goddard’s on the corner. If the
kid had wanted to get out without being seen he might
have left the back of his house and come along this court
to any of the passage-ways that lead out to the sidewalk
nearer the gate.”</p>

<p>“True for you,” Dennis assented. “Turn the light
along the back wall till we see how high it is, and whether
there are any little doors in it or not.”</p>

<p>But the wall, not of brick but of ancient brownstone,
was as high as the city’s regulations permitted, bare save
in the rear of Orbit’s miniature palace, where it was
covered by a thick, impenetrable curtain of ivy, sable and
glossy like black satin in the moving finger of light.</p>

<p>All at once heavy footsteps pounded along the sidewalk
to the mouth of the passage-way they had just left
and a brighter beam was trained suddenly upon them.
Dennis dodged instinctively but McCarty turned and
faced it, calling cautiously:</p>

<p>“Is it you, Dave Hollis? We’ve not gone yet, just
taking a look around.”</p>

<p>They had encountered the night watchman when they
let themselves in at the west gate earlier in response to
Eustace Goddard’s summons, and now he merely grunted
in acknowledgment and passed on.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing more to be seen here,” Dennis remarked.
“No one could cross that wall without a ladder
and though they might climb that ivy it could not be
done carrying a boy the size of Horace.”</p>

<p>“To say nothing of it being broad day and the back
windows of all the houses in this row looking out at the
performance,” McCarty interjected. “All the same we’ll
stroll along to the Goddards’ kitchen door and back,
Denny.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>The rear of Mrs. Bellamy’s mansion was as dark as the
front and in Orbit’s also the lights had by now been extinguished.
In the dead stillness their stealthy footsteps
seemed to ring unnaturally loudly to their own ears.
Only in the Goddard house did the dull glow from roof
to cellar gleam forth through shrouded windows like
sleepless, anxious eyes.</p>

<p>“’Tis almost unhealthy, the cleanness of everything!”
Dennis looked about him as the flashlight circled over the
spacious, immaculate court. “Not an ashcan nor so
much as a garbage pail that a cat could hide behind!
We’re wasting our time here, Mac!”</p>

<p>But McCarty did not answer. He had gone halfway
down the tradesmen’s passage leading to the sidewalk and
paused before a door in the side wall of the Goddard
house. Dennis saw the light play in narrowing arcs over
the paved ground before it and then settle to a mere pin-point
as McCarty stooped. After a moment he straightened
and came swiftly back, cat-footed despite his bulk.
He was holding out some small object in his extended
hand and as he reached his companion’s side he played
the light upon it—a small, plain platinum watch, crushed
beyond repair, on a pathetically short leather wristband.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE MAN IN THE SHADOWS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> cold, early light of a clouded morning found McCarty
and Dennis seated over pancakes and coffee
in an all-night restaurant on Sixth Avenue not far from
Fiftieth Street. The intervening hours since they left
the New Queen’s Mall had been fruitlessly spent in a
weary round of the ferries and railroad terminals in
search of news of a small, solitary traveler and now they
had just come from an interview with the superintendent
of the palatial studio apartment building in which the
artist Blaisdell resided, whose exact address a nearby
druggist had been fortuitously able to supply.</p>

<p>“I always thought those painter guys lived in garrets
with never a square meal nor a second shirt,” Dennis
spoke in a slightly dazed tone. “I mind that day watchman
Bill said young Horace told him Blaisdell was one
of the greatest in the country, but he must have some
regular business to be able to live in a place like that!
There’s one thing sure; no matter how much of a fancy
he’d took to the kid he could afford to get into no trouble
by taking him on a tour without his father and mother being
willing, and if the boy showed up he’d bring him
back. Where is it again that he’s gone sketching?”</p>

<p>“Up in the She-wan-gunk Mountains,” McCarty pronounced
the name with painstaking care. “Ellenville
is his headquarters, the superintendent said, if you remember;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
the Detweiler House. Granting there was a
train, and the lad had more money with him than that
four-eyed tutor suspected, he could have got there by
early evening, but no word of any kind had come when I
’phoned the Goddard house an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Dennis drained his cup and held it out to
the sleepy waiter to be refilled. “’Tis too bad you did
not tell Trafford about finding the watch.”</p>

<p>“And send him into hysterics? He’s as bad as a woman
now!” McCarty shrugged. “The doctor give orders
Mrs. Goddard wasn’t to be woke up till eight but we’ll
chance it by seven. How do you feel, Denny?”</p>

<p>Dennis eyed the questioner with swift suspicion.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing the matter with me that I know of!”</p>

<p>“’Tis a pity!” McCarty commented callously. “I was
thinking if you called up the lieutenant at the engine house
and told him how sick you were he’d maybe let you off
duty the day. There’s a ’phone over on the cigar counter.”</p>

<p>“And what’s ailing me?” Dennis’ eyes sparkled but his
tone was flat for his inventive faculties were at low ebb in
the early morning.</p>

<p>“From what I’ve learned lately, Denny, about mental
defectives—!”</p>

<p>But Dennis had risen and stalking to the counter he
took up the ’phone. Presently McCarty heard his voice
raised in a harrowing description of pain but it was
abruptly cut short, and, after listening for a moment with
a dazed look on his face, he silently replaced the receiver
and returned to his chair.</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded McCarty expectantly.</p>

<p>“Mike’s out of the hospital and he’ll take my nine-to-six
shift.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“But just what did the lieutenant say to you?”</p>

<p>“He told me,” Dennis replied very slowly and distinctly,
“to get the hell off the ’phone, for I’d be no good at a
false alarm while my crook-chasing side-kick McCarty
was on the job again. I gathered from a few more remarks
before he hung up on me that your friend Jimmie
Ballard of the ‘Bulletin’ has been nosing around the engine
house, to get dope from me about what you’re pulling
off, and by that same token running the lieutenant
ragged; ’tis what I get for associating with you.”</p>

<p>It was McCarty’s turn to eye his companion suspiciously
but Dennis’ stolid countenance was quite devoid
of humor and he retorted:</p>

<p>“Is that so? Well, we’d better be associating ourselves
with the Goddards again now or there’ll be no news for
Jimmie or the inspector either, which is worse. Come
on.”</p>

<p>“Unless the boy is found as Hughes was,” Dennis suggested
optimistically. “It would let the Lindholms out,
but who except a lunatic would be poisoning children and
servants, promiscuous-like?”</p>

<p>McCarty’s reply was a stare and a grunt which the
other construed as derisive and he lapsed into aggrieved
silence as they made their way once more to the gates,
behind which so much mystery and menace brooded.</p>

<p>Trafford opened the door almost before the bell had
ceased to echo through the house and his haggard face
was mute evidence that the suspense had not been lifted.</p>

<p>“Have you—?” He could not voice the rest of the
question but McCarty replied briskly:</p>

<p>“We’ve several possibilities, Trafford, and we’re following
every last one of ’em up. No news is good news just
now. Is Mrs. Goddard awake yet, do you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“Her maid told me when I inquired a few minutes
ago that she was stirring. I’ll go and see.” The young
tutor turned dispiritedly away. “You’ll find Mr. Goddard
in the smoking-room at the rear on the Avenue side.”</p>

<p>In dimensions and ponderous style of furnishing the
smoking-room resembled a club lounge rather than a
private apartment and it was a full minute before they
descried Eustace Goddard’s rotund figure relaxed in the
depths of a huge leather armchair. He was apparently
asleep but on their approach he opened widely staring
eyes upon them and sprang up with an inarticulate cry.</p>

<p>“We’ve not located your son yet, Mr. Goddard,” McCarty
spoke quickly before the father could frame words.
“We know what every minute means to you and ’tis for
that we’re going to bring the inspector and some of his
other men into it. I can promise you there’ll be no publicity
through us.”</p>

<p>“By God, McCarty, they can blazon it in every paper in
the land if it will bring our boy back to us!” Goddard
cried brokenly. “The horror of this night has made
everything else unimportant! You mean you—you’ve
failed?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly, sir, but there are only the two of us
now and ’twill save time if others take up some of the
clues we’ve got,” McCarty explained.</p>

<p>“There’s the telephone,” Goddard waved a shaking
hand toward a stand half concealed behind a lacquered
screen. “Get the whole department if you need it. I’ll
offer any reward you suggest—fifty thousand? A
hundred?”</p>

<p>“We’ll settle that when the inspector comes.” McCarty
moved to the screen and took up the receiver, and Dennis
cleared his throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“How many doors are there to this house?”</p>

<p>“Four!” Goddard replied in a surprised tone. “The
one at the front, two at the rear—kitchen and tradesmen’s
entrances—and a smaller door at the side opening on
the court that runs between this house and Orbit’s. But
why do you ask? What are the clues you’ve found?”</p>

<p>Dennis coughed discreetly, and from behind the screen
came McCarty’s voice.</p>

<p>“Is it yourself, Inspector?... Yes, me, McCarty.... No,
at Goddard’s and you’re needed.... Wait a
bit! Can you lay hands on both Martin and Yost?... Can’t
talk now, sir. Get me?... All right, bring Martin
along but send Yost over to—to Bill, 0565.... That’s
it.... Maybe and maybe not.... Sure, I’ve
been in touch with Bill and he knows the party I’m looking
for. Tell Yost to wait and ’phone here if anything
turns up.... Of course not, Inspector, till you take it
in hand! ’Bye.”</p>

<p>The last had been straight blarney, but Dennis shivered
as the receiver clicked on its hook. Well he knew that
telephone number and the grim little house far over toward
the river where, for a brief interval, the bluff, kindly
Bill harbored the city’s unknown dead! Had the sickly
little Goddard heir gone the way of Hughes after all?</p>

<p>“Why did you ask about the doors?” The conversation
had evidently held only its obvious meaning for the
man before them. “Horace must have been induced in
some way to leave the house, for no one could have entered
with Trafford and all the servants about!”</p>

<p>“He did leave, and by the side door,” McCarty held
out the shattered little wristwatch. “Does this belong
to the lad?”</p>

<p>“Good God, yes! He wore it yesterday!” Goddard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
seized it and then sank into his chair. “It’s—smashed!
He must have been handled brutally, perhaps even—!”</p>

<p>“That don’t follow, sir!” McCarty interrupted. “The
strap slips out of the buckle easy, for I tried it, and the
lad might have dropped it without noticing. Anybody
going to one of the back doors could have come along and
trod on it after, for ’twas in the alley right in front of the
door that I found it. And now—”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Goddard is awake and ready to see you now,”
Trafford’s voice sounded from the threshold and Goddard
started up once more.</p>

<p>“She knows there is no news?” he asked, and at the
tutor’s nod added: “Come then, but don’t tax her beyond
her strength and don’t mind any—any wild statements
which she may make. My poor wife is almost out
of her mind!”</p>

<p>“Of course; we understand,” McCarty darted a quick
glance at Dennis and then turned to the tutor. “Trafford,
Inspector Druet and another man are on their way
up from headquarters and you’ll be helping matters if
you tell the both of them what’s happened and all about
them you ’phoned to for trace of the lad.”</p>

<p>In silence they followed Goddard to the tiny jewel-box
of an elevator, whose velvet and gold and glittering crystal
mirrors made Dennis gasp. He gasped again when their
guide pressed a button and they shot abruptly upward and
his weatherbeaten face turned a delicate green as they
stopped with a smooth but sickening swoop at the second
floor. He was the first out with the opening of the
door, but there was no time for the aside which trembled
on his lips, for Goddard led the way down the wide hall to
the doorway in which the figure of an elderly maid was
silhouetted against the dim light of the room within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“Eustace!” A woman’s trembling voice sounded from
behind her. “It can’t be that nothing is known, nothing!
Did you tell them about that—”</p>

<p>“Everything is being done, Clara.” Goddard motioned
the maid aside and McCarty and Dennis followed him
into the dressing-room. They received only a confused
impression of mahogany and old-rose and tall mirrors,
of a faint, aromatic perfume and the sound of deep-drawn,
convulsive breathing. The next moment their
eyes were caught and held by the long figure outstretched
upon a chaise-longue, imposing even in the dishevelled
abandonment of grief. Mrs. Goddard was a woman well
over forty, but her distraught face still bore traces of the
beauty which must normally have been hers. There was
no touch of gray in the masses of luxuriant dark hair
which the maid had arranged with evident haste, but that
night had etched lines about the fine eyes and the firm
though sensitive mouth that would never be erased.</p>

<p>As her husband went on speaking, her glance swept
past him to the two who waited at his elbow.</p>

<p>“Everything that is humanly possible is being done,
my dear!” Goddard repeated more emphatically. “These
are the police officers I called in, and they want to ask you
a few questions. Do you think you can collect yourself
enough to stick to facts and not foolish, morbid fancies?”</p>

<p>“I am quite collected, Eustace!” There was a note almost
of defiance in Mrs. Goddard’s tones and she sat up
among her pillows with an unconscious dignity, in spite
of the emotion which she held in check with such obvious
effort. “Ask me anything you please! I—I only want
my baby safe once more!”</p>

<p>“Of course, ma’am,” McCarty responded soothingly.
“You went out and left the lad on the couch in the library<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
and when you came back to get ready for the musicale
next door you thought he was with his teacher. Now,
what was the first you knew of his disappearance?”</p>

<p>“When I returned from the musicale. It was late,
after six, and my husband met me in the hall with the
news. He and Mr. Trafford had been telephoning everywhere!
They thought Horace might have gone to some
of our friends, but he had never done such a thing as to
leave the Mall without our knowledge and I knew that
something terrible had happened. I could feel it—here!”
Her slender, very white hands flew to her breast. “I cannot
blame Mr. Trafford for not starting the search for
Horace in the early afternoon; he supposed he had slipped
away to the studio of an artist who has taken a great
fancy to our little boy, but Mr. Blaisdell is not in
town.”</p>

<p>The forced composure still held her and only her fluttering
hands and quick-drawn breath gave evidence of her
supreme agitation.</p>

<p>“You don’t think the lad has gone to join him, do you?”
McCarty asked.</p>

<p>“Run away, you mean?” Mrs. Goddard shook her
head slowly. “Oh, no! Horace would never dream of
such a thing! Mr. Blaisdell wanted to take him but we
would not hear of it and Horace had no idea of disobeying
our wishes. He has never been away from us before—before
yesterday!”</p>

<p>“Then you think he has been kidnapped?”</p>

<p>At the question Goddard, who had moved around to
the other side of the couch, took a step forward, the sagging
muscles of his round face tightening as his jaw
tensed but his wife did not take her eyes from those of
McCarty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“He isn’t here!” her trembling voice broke. “He
wouldn’t run away! The earth didn’t open and—and an
avalanche descend upon him! It must have been that
man!”</p>

<p>“What man!” McCarty and Dennis spoke in chorus,
and then Goddard placed his hand on his wife’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Now, Clara!” he admonished. “You promised—!”</p>

<p>“To give us facts, Mr. Goddard!” interrupted McCarty
sternly. “If Mrs. Goddard can tell us whatever it was
you were holding back last night so much the better!
You ’phoned to me that the lad had been kidnapped but
you couldn’t give me any reason for thinking so except
that he was gone, and you didn’t breathe a word about any
‘man’!—Will you tell us, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to tell!” Goddard insisted obstinately.
“My wife is nervous, imaginative, and so is Horace. He
was badly frightened by a strange man here in the Mall
a short time ago and his mother was quite frantic about
it. It was some days before she would allow him to go
out alone again, but personally I think he exaggerated—”</p>

<p>“Our boy would not tell a falsehood!” Mrs. Goddard
interrupted. “It was just at dusk one afternoon about a
fortnight ago, or perhaps less, when Horace had returned
alone from Mr. Blaisdell’s studio. He entered the Mall
by the east gate as usual, but stopped to play with a little
white Persian kitten, the pet of Mrs. Bellamy’s baby.
Mrs. Bellamy lives just two doors away, next to Mr. Orbit’s.
The watchman had passed him and gone on toward
the west gate when all at once the kitten darted across the
street and Horace followed, afraid that it might become
lost. It ran into the open court between the Parsons
house and the closed one next door belonging to the
Quentin estate and Horace was stooping to coax it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
him when he was seized from behind by a strange man
and searched!”</p>

<p>“Searched?” echoed McCarty.</p>

<p>“Yes. The man pressed Horace back against him with
one hand over his mouth and felt in all his pockets with
the other, but he took nothing and never uttered a word!
My little son was too startled to struggle at first, and all
at once the man released him—and disappeared!”</p>

<p>“Did the boy have any money with him?” Dennis
could contain himself no longer.</p>

<p>“Three or four dollars, I believe, but the man left it
untouched.” Mrs. Goddard’s eyes shifted to those of
the questioner. “It was quite dark there in that narrow
space between the two houses, but Horace saw the face
which bent down over his distinctly and he said the man
was an utter stranger whom he had never seen in the Mall
before; rough, unshaven and desperate looking!”</p>

<p>“Which way did he go?” McCarty took up the interrogation
once more. “Was it down the alley to the street
or up in the open court behind the houses?”</p>

<p>“How could the child tell?” Goddard interjected before
his wife could speak. “It was almost dark and he was
terror-stricken!”</p>

<p>“Horace told us that the man ran toward the rear and
disappeared in the shadows of a doorway at—at the left,”
Mrs. Goddard replied, as though her husband had not
spoken.</p>

<p>“At the left, facing the rear of the houses on the north
side of the way?” McCarty was thinking rapidly aloud.
“That’ll be Parsons’ house then!—Why didn’t you want
us to know this, Mr. Goddard?”</p>

<p>“Because it can have no possible bearing on the disappearance
of our son yesterday!” Goddard retorted hotly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
“He ran home immediately and told us, and I instituted
a thorough search without delay, but the watchman could
find no trace of the fellow and insisted he had admitted no
one that day through either gate who resembled Horace’s
description. The Parsons’ servants had seen nothing of
him and he has not reappeared since, although a strict
watch was kept. It is madness to suppose that Horace
left this house of his own accord to meet the fellow, when
he stood in mortal terror of him—!”</p>

<p>“Not unless he met him accidental-like and got waylaid
a second time!” Dennis broke in irrepressibly.
“There’s no telling what he was after if ’twas not money,
but if he was crazy and the boy put up a bit of a struggle—!”</p>

<p>“A-a-ah!” Mrs. Goddard’s taut nerves gave way and
she broke into a low, wailing cry. “That is my fear!
No sane person would harm him; but all night long in
horrible dreams I have seen him—! My baby! He is
hidden somewhere, helpless, suffering, and I cannot reach
him! I shall go mad!”</p>

THE CLOSED HOUSE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“A fine</span> mess you made of that!” McCarty remarked
disgustedly when the door of Mrs. Goddard’s
dressing-room had closed behind them, shutting in her
husband and the maid. “Just when we were on the point
of getting at the truth, too!”</p>

<p>“Truth, is it?” Dennis retorted. “I suppose you mean
you’d have been finding out what the crazy guy expected
to find in the boy’s pockets!”</p>

<p>“No, I know that already!” McCarty emitted a grim
chuckle. “’Twill keep, though, for we’ve got quick
work ahead of us now and the inspector must have been
waiting this long while.”</p>

<p>“You can shoot yourself down in that birdcage if
you’ve a mind to, but my own legs will carry me!” Dennis
eyed the elevator door, cunningly concealed in the high
oak paneling of the hall, with a hostile glare. Then he
added sarcastically: “I’ve no doubt but that, by the new
book learning you’ve got lately, you know who the guy
was, too, and where he came from and how he got out,
through solid walls and barred gates! Education is a
grand thing, but where is Horace? Answer me that!”</p>

<p>“If we’re not able to answer that soon, Denny, I’m
thinking it would be best left unanswered forever, for the
sake of that woman back there.” McCarty spoke with
deep earnestness. “There’s a feeling in me that we’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
something working against us more than human, something
worse than lightning or the plague, even! If we
could only see our way clear to the black heart of it!”</p>

<p>They went down the stairs together, to find the inspector
and Martin awaiting them with Trafford, who appeared
crushed from the gruelling half hour through
which he had passed.</p>

<p>McCarty addressed him first, with a mere nod to his
superior.</p>

<p>“Trafford, why didn’t you tell me about the man who
grabbed the lad in the alley not two weeks ago?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Goddard forbade me,” the wretched young man
stammered, then drew himself up with a vain assumption
of dignity. “Since it has nothing to do with the
case—”</p>

<p>“We’re the best judges of that!” McCarty waved him
away peremptorily. “Tell Mr. Goddard we’ll see him
later.... Now, inspector, before we talk, if you’ll follow
a suggestion of mine just once more, there’s a train
Martin will be after catching and he’ll have to hustle to
do it.”</p>

<p>The inspector eyed him keenly for a moment and then
nodded.</p>

<p>“Go to it,” he said briefly. “Get the instructions,
Martin.”</p>

<p>McCarty drew the young operative aside and after a
brief interchange of words the latter took his departure.
Then the inspector motioned the other two into the library
and closed the door.</p>

<p>“Now I want an explanation of this!” he announced,
in a tone which took McCarty swiftly back to the old
days. “Why didn’t you report to me at once when you
learned what had happened? What have you two been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
doing since? I made you deputies, but by the Lord I
didn’t appoint you chiefs!”</p>

<p>McCarty told him in detail of their activities during
the night and added frankly:</p>

<p>“I didn’t report, inspector, because I wanted a few
hours’ the start of you, and that’s the truth. So far, I’ve
only done what I think you would have, yourself, but
I’m working from an angle of my own that you’d not
have taken. I’ve sent Martin just now to Ellenville, to
find out if this Blaisdell has heard anything of the lad,
but that’s only routine; the real job is here in the Mall,
even if Horace turns up dead or alive somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“What’s this angle of yours on the case?” the inspector
demanded curtly. “What did Goddard forbid that tutor
mentioning and why?”</p>

<p>McCarty described the interview with Mrs. Goddard
and the inspector listened attentively, asking when he had
finished:</p>

<p>“What do you propose to do? Put the screws on Goddard
to find out why he kept that back? He can’t be a
party to the kidnapping of his own son!”</p>

<p>“No, but he thinks he knows who the fellow was, and
that he’ll hear from him or them back of him soon with
a view to ransom; he’s ready to offer fifty or a hundred
thousand reward, whenever you give the word. Until
he does hear from him, though, he can’t be sure what
happened to the lad and that’s why he’s anxious. His
wife don’t know anything about this private opinion of
his, of course, and naturally she’s half-crazed,” McCarty
summed up as though his process of deduction was equally
clear to his two companions. “We’ll leave him worry
awhile, for ’tis my opinion he’s mistaken entirely. I want
a look now inside that empty house next to the Parsons’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
across the street and there’s no time to wait for red tape
to get permission.”</p>

<p>“The Quentin house, that’s been closed all these years?”
The inspector looked fixedly at him and Dennis gaped.
“You think the fellow might have hidden there after letting
the little boy go? Come on, we’ll take a chance.”</p>

<p>A huge dark blue limousine of impressive aspect was
just drawing up before Number Seven as they emerged
from the Goddard house and crossed the street. At sight
of the distinguished, gray-bearded man who alighted and
went up the steps the inspector halted with an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Do you know who that is, Mac? The ambassador to
whom the mayor gave the keys of the city only yesterday
down at City Hall! If he comes himself to call on the
Parsons family they’re of more importance even than I
thought!”</p>

<p>“And ’tis small wonder they don’t bother to associate
with the rest on the block, millionaires or no,” McCarty
commented, eyeing the equipage with vast respect as they
passed. “You said the old gentleman was—?”</p>

<p>He paused suddenly and Dennis’ eyes followed his to
the great entrance doors which were closing slowly behind
the aristocratic back of the ambassador. There was
just a glimpse of a thin, sallow-faced manservant in
black, who appeared to sweep the trio with a curiously
penetrating gaze and then the scene was shut out.</p>

<p>McCarty seemed to have lost interest in the question he
was about to ask and they went on in silence to the narrow,
paved court between the Parsons residence and the
vast, rambling pile of brownstone next door.</p>

<p>“Let’s go up here and see if the rear is open for the
length of the block, the way it is on the other side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
street,” McCarty suggested. “There’s Parsons’ side door,
the one Horace said the man disappeared into; it’s pretty
deep, you see, deep enough for him to have just stepped
into the embrasure and been hid in the shadows of late
afternoon without actually going through the door itself,
though I don’t say he didn’t, at that!”</p>

<p>“’Tis likely a nut that’d go around grabbing children
and searching their pockets would be let into the Parsons’!”
Dennis exclaimed in fine scorn. “Unless the boy
made the whole thing up for a sensation, the way some
kids do, how’d the man get in and out of the block? The
house on this side looks to be boarded up, as tight as
a drum.”</p>

<p>They reached the rear and found the open court which
extended along behind the houses, to be even wider than
that on the south side of the street, the back wall higher
and devoid of a single vine. The silent Quentin house
presented as blank an aspect as from the front, its sealed
windows and barred doors staring like blind eyes in the
sunlight. The inspector shook his head.</p>

<p>“No one has entered here in months; years maybe,” he
remarked. “The padlocks are so rusted on those board
doors that they would have to be broken and the boards
themselves are weatherbeaten and rotting. I’m surprised
they’d let the place get into such a condition, even though
it is in litigation.... What are you doing, Riordan?”</p>

<p>The house, being the corner one, was built around in
an ell on the Madison Avenue side and in the right angle
formed by its two walls a leader descended from the roof.
Dennis was examining and testing it speculatively. At
the inspector’s question he turned.</p>

<p>“Do you mind, sir, ’twas a wide shiny mark burnished
on a pipe running across the top of an air-shaft that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
showed Mac and me how a murderer had swung himself
down on a rope and in at a window, in the first case ever
he butted in on after he left the Force?” he asked.
“This rain-pipe looks to be too frail to bear the weight of
a cat, but ’tis not a cat rubbed the rust off here, and here,
so it shines like new tin! I put on a clean shirt yesterday,
more’s the pity, but hold my coat and hat, Mac.”</p>

<p>“Mind or you’ll break your neck!” McCarty warned,
forgetful of his friend’s calling, as he complied. Dennis
scorned to reply but swarmed up the straining, creaking
leader to the second floor, swinging out to land lightly
and sure-footedly on the broad sill of a window two feet
away. The leader, released suddenly from his weight,
tore loose from its fastening and canted crazily against
the angle of the wall, shaking and clattering, and McCarty
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“You’ll not be coming down the way you went up!”</p>

<p>“True for you!” Dennis sang out with a note of rising
excitement. “I’ll be coming down the way the last guy
did who lit here, and that’s by the inside! Wait you there
for me.”</p>

<p>He had been examining the sill upon which he stood
and the boards which covered the window, pressing experimentally
upon the latter. Suddenly one of them gave
way, forced inward with an accompanying crash of glass.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve done it!” McCarty observed superfluously.
“Look out there is not more than us waiting for
you inside!”</p>

<p>“I’ve my flashlight, thanks be, and my two fists,”
Dennis responded. “That board wasn’t tight; the nails
had just been stuck back in the holes. Here goes another!”</p>

<p>With the rending of wood the second followed the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
and with a third which he wrenched loose Dennis smashed
in the fragments of glass which still clung to the sash,
then wriggled lithely through the aperture and disappeared.
McCarty drew a long breath and turned to his
former superior.</p>

<p>“I’d like to be following him,” he said wistfully. “If
so be some guy is hiding in there—the same one that
grabbed the lad—he’ll be desperate enough to kill, and
Denny’s too slow-thinking and slow-moving to take care
of himself! I’m heftier than him and ’tis long since I
did any shinnying, but maybe that pipe would hold me
after all!”</p>

<p>“A man with four medals from the fire department for
meritorious conduct and conspicuous bravery doesn’t need
a nursemaid, Mac!” the inspector responded with a laugh.
“Personally, I don’t believe any one’s been in there for
months before him but—what’s that?”</p>

<p>“That” was a sudden subdued commotion within, a
long-sustained clatter followed by a reverberating thud
and then a silence ominous in its intensity.</p>

<p>“I knew it!” McCarty dropped the hat and coat and
made for the wooden barrier that sealed the main back
door. “I’m going in if I break the whole damn’ place
down! Denny! Denny! I’m coming!”</p>

<p>His reassuring roar was lost in the mighty smash of his
fist on the rotting boards but after the first blow the inspector
reached him and dragged him back.</p>

<p>“Have you taken leave of your senses?” the latter demanded.
“You’ll have the whole block aroused to find us
breaking and entering! Riordan’s all right!—There, I
hear somebody moving about inside. Listen!”</p>

<p>McCarty waited, panting and tense, and faintly there
came to his ears the sound as of stumbling footsteps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
within and a scratching noise from a window at the left
of the door which, being protected by an iron grill-work,
had been left unboarded. A heavy green shade hung
close against the inner side of the dirty windowpane,
furrowed by many past rainstorms, and the stout bars
seemed at a glance to be firmly imbedded in the broad
stone sill but McCarty strode to them and began trying
them one by one, while behind him the inspector drew his
revolver and stood expectant.</p>

<p>“Look here, sir!” McCarty whispered. “’Tis fine
burglar protection they’ve got in these houses! See how
this bar slides up into its groove in the top of the casement,
till you can pull it out below and down over the sill
entirely? I’ll bet the next will work the same.—It does!
If we’d taken the trouble to find this out at first—! Glory
be, here’s Denny himself!”</p>

<p>The green shade had flown up and the face of Dennis
appeared in a sickly yellow aura cast by his flashlight, but
he promptly extinguished it and set to work on the catch
of the window. As McCarty removed the fourth bar
the sash opened upward and the two, who had meanwhile
been exchanging grimaces pregnant with meaning gazed
silently at each other for a full minute. Then McCarty
found his voice.</p>

<p>“Where is he!” he demanded. “What did you do with
him? We heard the row out here—!”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any ‘him,’” Dennis interrupted sheepishly.
“It was me, by myself. I came on the stairs unexpected-like
and took the whole flight of them without
even breaking my flashlight!—But come in, the both of
you, and see what I found!”</p>

<p>McCarty scrambled over the sill and Inspector Druet,
despite his added years, followed with the effortless ease<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
of a boy. They found themselves in a large room bare
of furniture but in the dust which lay like a heavy carpet
upon the floor a meandering trail of footsteps, many times
traversed, ran from the window by which they had entered
to a connecting door opening into a laundry. Dusty
finger-marks, with here and there the imprint of a whole
hand, were plainly outlined on the white woodwork of the
inner sill and below it greasy pieces of wrapping paper
were scattered. In a corner two pitchers and several
small tin cans were heaped.</p>

<p>“Some one has been camping out here, that’s evident,”
the inspector remarked. “Getting his food handed in to
him through that window, too!”</p>

<p>“And it wasn’t any ordinary bought stuff, the kind that
comes ready fixed in stores.” McCarty was poking about
in the papers. “Here’s the carcass of a whole chicken,
pieces of fancy rolls and pastry and other stuff, but it’s all
stale; it’s been here for four or five days, at least.”</p>

<p>“And there’s traces of coffee in those pitchers and cans,
to say nothing of the wine bottles on that shelf!” Dennis
pointed impatiently. “He’s been living on the fat of the
land from one of the houses in this row and the nearer
the likelier, even if it does happen to be occupied by the
Parsons! Come upstairs till I show you more.”</p>

<p>The larger adjoining room had evidently been the
laundry, for rows of enameled tubs and washing machines
were ranged against the wall and dryers stood about, but
all were covered with a thick blanket of dust. Dennis led
the way through a series of kitchens and pantries, far
more elaborate than those they had encountered in Orbit’s
house, to the back stairs and up to the second floor rear,
into the room with the broken window. All the way they
had followed that zigzag trail of overlapping footsteps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
and here the floor was crossed and recrossed by a network
of them. This apartment had evidently been one of the
master bedrooms, for a well-appointed, marble-lined bath
opened from it and heavy, old-fashioned furniture of
richly carved mahogany was ranged with stiff precision
about the room. A half-burned candle, shielded from the
window by an old cardboard box-cover, stood on a side
table together with a handful of matches and some
cigarette stubs. McCarty pointed to it.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t live without a light but he hid it from
the window and he didn’t dare carry it when he went
down to get his food; that’s why those footprints ramble
so, he was feeling his way in the dark. That bed looks
as if it had been slept in, with all those old draperies
piled on it, and what’s in that big pitcher on the bureau?”</p>

<p>“Water,” Dennis replied. “There’s still a little left,
though you can see from the marks on the inside where
it has dried down.”</p>

<p>“Evaporated?” The inspector nodded. “That would
show, too, that whoever the fellow was he hadn’t used
any of it for a few days at least.—Hello, what’s this?”</p>

<p>He had turned to the bathroom and after a moment he
emerged from it holding a bright, new razor, a piece of
soap and a very dirty Turkish towel.</p>

<p>“The water has been turned off in the pipes of course,
but there is an empty bucket in there in which some must
have been brought to him, and he seems to have had some
regard to his personal appearance, at least. The Goddard
boy said the man who had tackled him was rough-looking
and unshaved, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“When he tackled him, yes,” McCarty replied. “He
had chance enough to clean up after, as soon as whoever
was helping him to hide here brought him the things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“He did more than that!” Dennis declared. There
was an unwonted flush on his leathery cheeks and his gray
eyes were alight with excitement. “Why do you suppose
he was hiding here, anyway? Why does anybody hide?
If ’tis not to do something unlawful, couldn’t he have
broken the law already and be hiding from it?”</p>

<p>“Denny!” McCarty breathed. “What are you getting
at? You’ve found out something! Who is the man?”</p>

<p>“Who’s wanted now, Inspector?” Dennis asked.
“Somebody that’s gentleman enough to keep shaved and
clean in spite of everything, who’d appreciate good food
and wine and the best in life, and yet was a convicted
criminal for all that!”</p>

<p>“‘Convicted—!’” McCarty started forward. “An ex-crook,
do you mean? How did you guess—?”</p>

<p>“‘Ex-crook,’ nothing!” retorted his confrère. “I’m
not up in the latest of prison styles but if this ain’t a
penitentiary get-up I’m an Orangeman!”</p>

<p>He flung open a closet door behind him, dived in and
dragged forth in triumph a tell-tale suit of stained and
ragged gray.</p>

<p>“Sing Sing!” exclaimed Inspector Druet. “Good
Lord, Riordan, you’ve made a find!—Do you remember,
Mac, that three men escaped last month? One was killed
making his getaway and another caught and transferred
to Dannemora, but the third of those that crashed out
then is still at large and there’s a big reward out!
Heaven knows how he managed to get into the Mall and
why he should have come here, of all places, but I’ll
stake my life that the man who has been hiding in this
house is George Radley!”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE BREATH OF DEATH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“Who</span> is he?” asked Dennis, wide-eyed. “Who
is this George Radley?”</p>

<p>“You remember, don’t you, Mac?” The inspector
turned to the ex-roundsman. “Radley was a young
chemist—”</p>

<p>“A chemist!” caroled McCarty and Dennis in unison.
Then their mouths shut like traps and they stared at each
other.</p>

<p>“What’s got into you two?” Inspector Druet demanded.
“This Radley was accused, together with an
accomplice, of sending poison to a mutual enemy, concealed
in candy. An innocent member of the man’s
household ate it and died, but the actual evidence against
the accused was so weak that they could only be convicted
of manslaughter after two disagreements and then
the accomplice only got two or three years and Radley
ten. He’ll have several more to serve yet, however,
even allowing for good behavior and then, too, a guard
was seriously injured in trying to prevent that crush-out,
so he’s wanted bad. He could never have got as far as
the city in those clothes!”</p>

<p>“He had others outside of ’em, either stole or slipped
to him.” Dennis returned to the closet and produced a
pair of dilapidated shoes, gray trousers and a long
mackinaw, together with a soft Panama hat. “Only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
shoes are ragged, you see; the rest is in pretty good condition
and there’s an umbrella in a corner of the closet.
He could have got past the watchman easy on a rainy
night, especially if he said he was coming to see a maid,
maybe, in one of the houses.—Still, that don’t account
for his grabbing the Goddard kid, if ’twas him, and going
through his pockets!”</p>

<p>“His clothes may be a find but we’ve not got himself
yet. What if he’s hid under this roof now?” McCarty
exclaimed. “He’d have no call to harm the Goddard lad
unless Horace found out he was here and was going to
give him away, but harm or no, if so he’s had no chance
to escape—!”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Mac!” The inspector dropped the
clothes he had been examining and started for the door.
“We’ll smoke him out!”</p>

<p>But a painstaking search of the great house from attic
to cellar failed to reveal any further trace of the refugee
and they departed at last through the open window in
the basement to round the corner into the court and
come face to face with Bill Jennings.</p>

<p>“Mr. Parsons’ butler next door sent me,” the watchman
explained. “He said somebody’d heard a noise in
there and I’d better see about it. Nothing wrong I
hope, inspector?”</p>

<p>Open curiosity rang in his tones but the official replied
bruskly:</p>

<p>“Nothing. We’ll go over the other empty houses on
the block later. It’s all right.”</p>

<p>“What’s this we’ve been hearing about a strange man
who scared the Goddard lad in this very court not two
weeks ago?” McCarty asked as they approached the sidewalk
once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>Bill Jennings looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“There was no strange man got between these gates
while I was on!” he averred defensively. “It must have
been some butler or houseman that works on the block,
trying to play a joke on the little feller. It was a week
ago Saturday that he raised the rumpus about it but
there wasn’t any sign of the rough-looking kind of guy
he described when Mr. Trafford and I looked, and we
went over every foot of the courts.... There’s Mr.
Orbit motioning.”</p>

<p>It was to the inspector and his deputies, however, that
Orbit beckoned and when they had crossed to him he
asked with grave concern:</p>

<p>“Is it true that Horace Goddard cannot be found?
One of the maids from next door told Jean, and said
that you had been notified, but I couldn’t believe it!
Trafford came to my house yesterday afternoon, though,
inquiring for him—but I forgot, McCarty and Riordan
were present. Is it possible that the little boy hasn’t
been seen since?”</p>

<p>“Not so far as we’ve been able to discover,” the inspector
responded. “It’s a pretty bad business. If he
was a normal, healthy, mischievous kid we’d be apt to
think he ran away, but from all accounts he was sickly
and timid, not the kind to strike out for himself.”</p>

<p>“Horace is very nervous and highly strung, with remarkable
artistic possibilities,” Orbit observed thoughtfully.
“I’m immensely interested in him and my friend
Blaisdell is of the opinion that he’ll become a great
painter some day if his people don’t kill his aspirations
by lack of sympathy; like a sensitive plant he needs encouragement,
nurturing.—But what can have happened
to him? If he isn’t with friends or relatives the child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
must have met with an accident! Has an alarm been
sent out?”</p>

<p>“We’re trying every way to locate him. He used to
run in and out of your house a lot, didn’t he? Did you
ever hear him speak of any one he might have gone to
now?” the inspector asked. “We know, of course, how
disappointed he was when his father and mother wouldn’t
let him go on a sketching tour with this Mr. Blaisdell
you mention, but he seems to have got over it. Do you
know if he had any boy friends his own age?”</p>

<p>Orbit shook his head.</p>

<p>“None. He is a solitary little chap, self-contained
and retiring, and I don’t think he cares very much for
the society of other boys. He would not have gone
away and remained like this without a word if he was
able to communicate with his family. It seems inexplicable!
Goddard must be dreadfully cut up about it,
to say nothing of the boy’s mother, and I feel badly myself!
I should hate to think of any accident happening
to him! I’m going in to see Goddard and ask if there
is anything I can do.—Meanwhile, you’ve no news for
me about Hughes’ strange death, have you? It is odd
that two such mysterious, unrelated incidents should have
occurred in less than a week, even though Hughes must
have taken the poison either accidentally or through someone’s
murderous intent, after he left the Mall that night.
Haven’t you come upon the slightest indication?”</p>

<p>“We’re working on several promising ones.” The
time-worn formula was repeated a trifle wearily. “Let
you know when there’s anything to give out, Mr. Orbit....
Come on, Mac; it’s nearly noon.”</p>

<p>Orbit turned toward the Goddard house but the others
had scarcely gone a half dozen steps in the opposite direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
when again they were halted. This time it was by
the pretty little French nurse and she drew the Bellamy
baby closer, gazing at McCarty with wide, affrighted
eyes as she voiced her question.</p>

<p>“Pardon, monsieur, but is it of a truth, that which I
have heard? Must it be that the little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</i> of that
house there is lost?”</p>

<p>“That’s about the size of it, ma’am,” McCarty removed
his reblocked derby with a flourish. “I don’t
suppose you saw him playing around anywheres yesterday
afternoon?”</p>

<p>“But no!” She caught her breath with a slight gasp.
“All the night he has been depart, alors! It is terrible,
that! He is so <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gentil</i>, so good, the little Horace! He
would not run away—is it that he have been stole’? Me,
I have fear for the little Maude—”</p>

<p>She hugged her small charge tighter and the baby
stared at them solemnly.</p>

<p>“There ain’t much danger of that!” McCarty laughed
reassuringly. “I guess the lad will turn up all right.
When did you see him last?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday morning, when he have passed with M’sieu
Trafford. Oh, if he has been keednap’ we do not go
beyond these gates!”</p>

<p>She nodded and led the child away slowly while Dennis
remarked:</p>

<p>“Pretty and a lady, but did ever you hear the like
of such lingo? No wonder them French have a fit when
they talk; ’tis from trying to understand each other.”</p>

<p>McCarty darted a quick glance at the harassed frown
on the inspector’s face, and then replied to his companion:</p>

<p>“She had it straight, though. Horace has ‘been depart’
all right, and if we don’t get him back soon there’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
be a bigger howl than ever from the chief!—Isn’t that
what you’re thinking, sir?”</p>

<p>The inspector nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>“I’m going to the agents in charge of these houses
and get the keys.” He indicated the two closed residences
east of Mrs. Bellamy’s. “Try to get a line meanwhile
on who slipped food to the man hiding over there
and what became of him and meet me here in an hour.”</p>

<p>“It’s not much he’s wanting,” Dennis remarked, as
the inspector left them abruptly and strode toward the
gate. “Still, if we could trace what cellar them wine
bottles came from that was stacked up on the shelf in
that empty house—look! The ambassador’s limousine is
going away.”</p>

<p>The impressive dark blue car was indeed moving slowly
away from the curb in front of the Parsons house and
the great front door closing. They caught another fleeting
glimpse of the sallow-faced manservant and then McCarty
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Come on! I want a few words with the butler over
there anyway, and maybe the old gentleman himself,
and don’t be putting in your oar, Denny, and rocking
the boat; I know what I’m after.”</p>

<p>Dennis followed in injured silence and they mounted
the steps of the stately house and rang the bell. A
lengthy pause ensued. McCarty was about to ring again
when the door opened suddenly and the manservant
whom they had seen a moment before stood confronting
them.</p>

<p>He paid no heed to Dennis but his dull, sunken eyes
fastened themselves on McCarty and as he stared his
sallow cheeks seemed to whiten.</p>

<p>“Hello, Porter. You remember me, I see,” the latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
said briskly. “Me and my friend here want to have a
little talk with you.”</p>

<p>“My name is not Porter; it’s Roberts,” the man replied
stiffly with an evident effort. “You’ve made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Not me, my lad!” McCarty spoke with easy assurance.
“Inspector Druet got you too, the other day,
but he didn’t bother you then because we didn’t know as
much as we do now.”</p>

<p>“By God, you’ll never frame me again!” The man
shrank back and a harsh, grating note came into his low
tones. “You haven’t got anything on me—!”</p>

<p>“Haven’t, hey? How about the neighbor you’ve had
next door for the past week or so?” McCarty inquired
while Dennis held his breath. “Look here, Porter, I
suppose you have been pretty well hounded and I don’t
want to be hard on you but I’m going to get the truth!”</p>

<p>“‘Neighbor!’” The pseudo-Roberts moistened his dry
lips. “I don’t know what you’re talking about—!”</p>

<p>“Maybe Mr. Parsons does, then; we’ll see him.” McCarty
made as though to push his way past the cowering
figure and the man threw out his hands.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake don’t, just when he’s giving me the
only square chance I’ve had!” It was more an agonized
whisper than speech. “I’m Porter all right but he knows
that! He knows I got railroaded and you bulls wouldn’t
let me go straight afterwards; that’s why he took me in.
I don’t know what you’re trying to hang on me now
but you’re not going to drag him into it! What do you
want of me?”</p>

<p>McCarty glanced down the long hall which seemed almost
bare in its lofty austerity, in spite of the richness
of the carved paneling and quaint old furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“Take us some place where we can talk without anybody
butting in,” McCarty suggested. “It’s for your
own sake, man! If you’ll come clean—?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that before!” Porter shrugged, with a
shadow of a dreary smile. “Come along back to my
pantry if you want to, but why don’t you take me right
downtown now and be done with it? If you’re out to
frame me, cut all the bluff!”</p>

<p>“Did I ever?” demanded McCarty. “Did I ever try
to send you or any other guy up unless I had the straight
goods on them?”</p>

<p>“I guess not, Mac. I haven’t got anything against
you but I’ve had a rough deal; what’s come now is just
the luck of the game, I suppose.” He closed the pantry
door carefully behind them and motioning to chairs he
leaned back against the table, gripping its edge with his
thin hands. “What do you want to know? I’ll come
clean all right—about myself.”</p>

<p>McCarty noted the almost imperceptible pause and
asked quickly:</p>

<p>“How long have you been out this time?”</p>

<p>“A year and a half. My lungs went back on me and
I would have been a goner if I hadn’t got pardoned, but
what good did it do me? Every time I got a job clerking
in a drug store one of the Narcotic Squad came along
with my record and I was kicked out. My record—God!
And I wasn’t guilty! I never knew my boss was
crooked and in with the dope ring, making me the
scapegoat!” His voice had roughened again with a
sort of savage earnestness. “I was about at the end of
my rope but the—the man who’d had me pardoned was
keeping his eye on me all the time and saw how hard I’d
tried and—and so Mr. Parsons took me on here to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
me a breathing spell. Anything else—about me—you
want to know?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” McCarty replied on a sudden inspiration.
“You were tried with Radley, weren’t you, and convicted
of sending that poisoned candy—?”</p>

<p>He paused and Porter shrugged again.</p>

<p>“What’s the comedy for? You got that from headquarters,
and nobody’s making a secret of it. It was that
old charge, the record of that first case that convicted me
again and it helped convict Radley, too, for we were both
of us innocent—but what’s the use of telling that to you
now?”</p>

<p>“There’ll be a lot of use in telling us, for your own
sake, what you had to do with the crush-out last month.”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I haven’t been outside these gates since I
came in June.”</p>

<p>“Then you didn’t know anything about it till Radley
showed up here a couple of weeks ago?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about it now, except what I
read in the papers.” Porter faced him squarely. “What
do you mean about Radley showing up?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t hide him in that empty house next door
and smuggle food and drinks, and a razor and clothes
in to him, did you?” McCarty paused for a moment
again, but Porter maintained a dogged silence and he
went on: “Does Benjamin Parsons know of it? ’Twill
be news to him to hear that after him taking you in
and all, you’ve been making him accessory after a crush-out—!”</p>

<p>“He’s accessory to nothing!” Porter interrupted. “I
know the law, for I have bitter reason to! He’s a fine
old man and believes in giving everybody a fair chance,
especially if they’ve been framed, but he’d do nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
against the law even if he thinks it’s in the wrong.
You’ve no proof that Radley was here or that any one
helped him to hide but I’m glad he made his getaway,
glad! I hope to God he’s never caught to go back to
that hell!”</p>

<p>“Even though you go, now?” McCarty demanded.
“You’ve one chance to keep clear of it, Porter, and
you’ll not be giving Radley away, either. We’re wise
already that ’twas you helped him to hide and then
make his getaway, but ’tis not Radley we’re after now
except as the alarm has gone out to the whole Force.
We’re on another lay entirely but we just want to find
out when he beat it away from the Mall and how he
got out. I never gave my word yet that I broke it, and
I’m giving it now that ’twill not be from me nor Riordan
either a hint will get out about your part in all
this.”</p>

<p>“You mean you’re not here to frame me nor kid me
into snitching on Radley?” A faint tremor of hope
ran through his tones as he gazed searchingly into the
honest, square-jawed face before him. “You’ve got a
name for fair play, Mac, and you’re on to enough already
to put me away again if you want to, so what I
tell you can’t matter.—It won’t hurt George Radley
either, as it happens.”</p>

<p>Dennis started violently and McCarty asked:</p>

<p>“Why can’t it? You don’t mean he’s croaked?”</p>

<p>“I mean I don’t know any more than you do when he
beat it or how he passed the gates, and that’s the God’s
truth!” Porter responded slowly, his gaunt, sallow face
twitching. “I read about his escape in the papers as I
told you and when the days passed and he wasn’t caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
I was happy thinking he had got clean away but I never
dreamed of him turning up here! Late one afternoon,
though,—never mind how long ago—I opened the side
door to find him all but leaning against it, weak from
hunger and thirst and fairly desperate. He’d got past
the watchman during a rainstorm a night or two before
to try to reach me, his old pal, and he’d been hiding
in that empty house next door, without food or water, not
daring to come openly and ask for me. When I didn’t
show myself he made up his mind to beat it, but he found
he couldn’t get out as easy as he’d got in, and he was
near crazy!”</p>

<p>“That’ll be a week ago last Saturday.” McCarty nodded.
“When you came on him he was just after grabbing
a kid that lives on the block here and searching his
pockets to see could he find if the lad had a key to the
gates—!”</p>

<p>“Glory be!” Dennis ejaculated beneath his breath.</p>

<p>“Yes. He was half off his head, but he didn’t hurt
the boy any, only scared him. I made him go back next
door and lay low till the search was over, and after
night-fall I took him some bread and meat and a bottle
of rare old port from the cellar. It was stealing, and
poor return for all the old gentleman has done for me,
but George needed it bad, and I figured I owed most to
him. He needed clothes too, but mine fitted him, and
I didn’t have to steal money for him either, because the
old gentleman pays me good and I’d been nowhere to
spend it. The trouble was how to get him through the
gates, for after the scare he’d given the boy both watchmen
were leery of strangers and if he was held up and
questioned I knew he’d go to pieces from the long strain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
he’d been under, and it would be all up with him.”
Porter reached for a silver jug of icewater which stood
on the table beside him and drank deeply, then replaced
it with a sigh of relief. “No one has keys except the
families themselves and I’d no chance to borrow Miss
Parsons’, of course, nor her niece, Miss Hester’s. The
old gentleman carries his on a ring and sleeps with it
under his pillow and though I tried twice to get it
he woke up both times; I had a job of it to explain
what I was doing in his room and I didn’t dare risk
it again. George was getting wild with the waiting
and worry, and took to prowling out at night in spite
of all I could say; I was getting pretty desperate myself
when all at once he’d gone, and that’s all I know.”</p>

<p>He straightened his narrow shoulders as though a
load were lifted from them and McCarty rose.</p>

<p>“When did you see him last?”</p>

<p>“Sunday night late when I went to take him some
food. I handed it in through the window and we talked
for a minute, but I didn’t dare stay longer. George
was almost ready to give himself up, for his nerve was
gone and it was all I could do to persuade him to wait.
We’d arranged that I was to go to him every other
night—I couldn’t risk it oftener—so I didn’t miss him
Monday. Last evening I got some rolls, a cold pheasant
and a half-bottle of burgundy and waited under the window
as long as I dared, but he didn’t come and finally
I took down the loose iron bars and let myself in.
There wasn’t the least sign of a light from his candle
and he didn’t answer when I took a chance and called,
so I left the food and came away, but I was awake all
night worrying and towards morning I went back and got
the stuff, which hadn’t been touched. I was afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
the cook would miss the pheasant and it might be found
and traced; I never thought about the wine bottles!”</p>

<p>“So he might have got away any time from Sunday
night on?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I’m giving it to you straight, Mac, and
I knew when I saw you an hour ago that you’d be
after me sooner or later, especially when Miss Parsons—the
old gentleman’s sister, Miss Priscilla—heard a noise
next door and told me to notify the watchman! I was
afraid it was all up with us last week when Inspector
Druet came, but it was about that valet from across the
street who was poisoned and the inspector didn’t even
let on he recognized me.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the kid that Radley tried to get a key
off of?” McCarty ignored the observation.</p>

<p>“Only by sight. Red-haired, isn’t he, and lives next
door to where that valet worked? I see him now and
then going by on the other side of the street.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen him since he got that scare?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.” Porter smiled faintly in surprise. “Only
a day or so ago. George didn’t mean to scare him even,—he
wouldn’t harm a fly!—but the thought of those
gates shutting him in as though he was back up the
river almost drove him mad!”</p>

<p>“You’ve been here since June, you say, Porter? Did
you know that valet who died?”</p>

<p>“No. I think I’ve seen him with the butler from
the next house, but I don’t want to know any of them.
I was glad enough to stay here and do a servant’s work
myself till I could get my nerve back to go out and hunt
up my own kind of a position again where the bulls
wouldn’t keep moving me on.” He smiled again, but
bitterly. “I guess there isn’t a chance of that now with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
you on! I’m not sorry, though; I’d do it again for
George! He was innocent, the same as me, and look
what was done to him!”</p>

<p>“If I find you’ve come clean I’ll keep my word, Porter,”
McCarty reiterated as he moved toward the door
with Dennis in tow. “You may not know it but I’m not
on the Force any longer, nor connected with headquarters
except to mix in now and then for old times’ sake, and
the inspector didn’t recognize you the other day; he
kind of knew your face but he couldn’t place you. Riordan
and me will just forget you laid eyes on Radley unless
it comes to a showdown, and then we’ll do what we
can for you.”</p>

<p>Cutting short the ex-convict’s broken thanks they took
their departure, to find Inspector Druet pacing impatiently
back and forth before the two closed houses opposite
and Dennis’ comments on the interview just ended
were necessarily curtailed.</p>

<p>“Did you get any dope from Parsons?” the inspector
asked.</p>

<p>“We didn’t even see him,” McCarty parried. “I was
getting a line on the servants; do you recall saying you’d
seen one or two of them before? Have you thought
where?”</p>

<p>“Lord, no! I’ve had enough else on my mind! I had
an idea one of the housemaids and the page-boy who
runs errands looked familiar, but there wasn’t anything
out of the ordinary about them.”</p>

<p>Dennis coughed and McCarty remarked hastily:</p>

<p>“I guess none of them knows what’s become of the
man who has been hiding next door, nor anything about
the Goddard lad and that’s all that matters right now,
isn’t it, sir? Did you get the keys to these houses?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, and explained again to that fool of a watchman,
Jennings. I had time to look around pretty thoroughly
outside them while I waited for you and I couldn’t
find a window or door that had been tampered with.
Let’s see what’s inside.”</p>

<p>One o’clock had come and gone and another hour
passed before they emerged from the second of the two
houses after a fruitless search. Dust and mold were
all they had encountered in the huge, echoing, partially
dismantled rooms and the footprints they themselves
left behind them were the only recent signs of human
presence.</p>

<p>Dennis blinked and drew in the fresh air deeply when
they stood once more in the sunlight.</p>

<p>“’Tis like coming out of a tomb!” he averred. “What’s
it to be now, inspector?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to Goddard and make him talk!” that
official responded with a certain grimness which was eloquent.
“Until he comes across with his suspicions as to
who kidnapped the boy our hands are tied and every hour
counts. You two had better get a bite to eat and meet me
at his house later.”</p>

<p>Nothing loth, they accepted the hint. It was mid-afternoon
before they approached the east gate of the Mall
again, to find Jennings energetically engaged in driving
away a swarthy vendor of toy balloons, whose basket
freighted with globes of bright, crude color bobbing
on slender sticks, resembled an uprooted garden patch
of strange, grotesque blooms.</p>

<p>“They’re a pest, those peddlers!” he declared as he
admitted them. “They’re not so bad, though, as the
reporters that have been trying to get in since you left!
Say, did you know Horace Goddard is lost—?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“Sure we know it!” McCarty interrupted. “Didn’t
Trafford tell you so himself yesterday afternoon?—Hurry,
Denny!”</p>

<p>Leaving the watchman staring speechlessly, they
quickened their pace toward the Goddard house and
were passing the entrance door of Orbit’s when it was
flung open and Ching Lee appeared.</p>

<p>For once the Chinaman’s wooden impassivity had
deserted him. His slant-eyes were rolling wildly, his
yellow face distorted and his queue streaked out behind
him like a tail as he plunged down the steps and seized
McCarty with an iron grip of long-nailed, tapering fingers.</p>

<p>“The nurse-baby!” he babbled, his singsong voice
high and shrill. “The Flench maid of next-door baby!
Come quick!”</p>

<p>“Lucette, do you mean? The Bellamy child’s nurse?”
McCarty halted. “Stop chattering like a monkey and
tell me where is she, and what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Lucette!” Ching Lee nodded vigorously and pointed
in at the open windows of the conservatory. “She is
the next! She has breathed the breath of death!”</p>

<span class="fs80">“THE HORROR DEEPENS!”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“‘The</span> breath of death!’” Dennis repeated, awestruck.
“God save us, what’s that? Are you
trying to say that the French girl is in Orbit’s house,
<em>dead</em>?”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see!” Shaking off the Chinese butler’s
grip McCarty dashed up the steps and in at the door, with
Dennis just behind and Ching Lee bringing up the rear,
chanting a weird refrain of lamentation.</p>

<p>The door of the huge conservatory also stood wide
and its humid breath, heavy with fragrance, stole out
to meet them, the silent organ with slender pipes gleaming
softly like silver birches in moonlight looming up
in the semi-gloom, but a group at the marble bench
facing it stood out against the background of leafy palms
and thorny cacti, holding their eyes irresistibly in dread
fascination.</p>

<p>Orbit’s tall figure, the Bellamy baby clasped tightly
in his arms, stood before it. Beside him Jean, the houseman,
was bending forward while little Fu Moy knelt at
its foot. On the bench itself a slender form lay relaxed
as though in sleep, the head with its bright hair
rippling from beneath the trim little bonnet resting against
the high, white stone back, the small gloved hands limply
extended at either side.</p>

<p>McCarty halted for an instant and Dennis crossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
himself but Ching Lee darted forward and seizing Fu
Moy dragged him away as though from the mouth
of some unnameable peril. Then Orbit turned, his face
white and set, and McCarty advanced to meet him.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, it is you!” The resonant, well-modulated
voice was hoarse and shaken. “Ching Lee
thought he caught a glimpse of you passing and I told
him to rush after you! McCarty, look—look at this
girl! What is this horror that has come to my
house!”</p>

<p>“Is it—dead, she is?” McCarty’s own tones were
reverently low. “How did it happen? What was she
doing here?”</p>

<p>“Listening to the organ! She was to all appearances
as bright and well as this little child but when I finished
playing and turned, she was as you see her now! I feel
as though I were going mad, as though I couldn’t credit
the evidence of my own eyes! What can this fearful
thing mean!”</p>

<p>“We’d better be finding out, Mr. Orbit!” McCarty
was rapidly recovering from the first shock and his quick
mind leaped to meet the exigencies of the tragic situation.
“Denny, run next door to Goddard’s and get the
inspector but not a word to anybody else!—Jean, take
the little one home to the other house and tell Mrs. Bellamy
that her nursemaid’s took sick here but will be
over it in a little while and she’s not to bother; understand?
Think you can put it so’s she won’t come tearing
in here to make a scene?”</p>

<p>Jean straightened and nodded, not trusting himself to
speak. His sensitive face was working but he controlled
his emotions by a valiant effort and took the baby whom
his employer held mechanically out to him. Little Maude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
broke into a low wail of dismay at the abrupt transition
and stretched out wavering, dimpled arms to the familiar
but strangely inattentive figure on the bench. Her sobs
echoed back to them as she was borne quickly from the
room.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Orbit, what did you do when you turned
from the organ and saw Lucette stretched out like this
on the bench?” McCarty began. “Where was the baby?
How did Ching Lee and Jean know that something was
wrong,—did you call them? Have you sent for anybody
else?”</p>

<p>Orbit passed his hand across his forehead as if dazed
and the other noticed that it came away glistening with
moisture.</p>

<p>“For the doctor, of course!” He replied to the last
question first. “Allonby, around on the next block. I
haven’t had a physician for years myself, but some of
my neighbors swear by him. I told Ching Lee to telephone
to him as soon as I could make myself realize that—that
she was gone!”</p>

<p>A slight shudder ran through him and he averted his
gaze from the rounded, childish face, relaxed as though
in sleep, save that the bright blue eyes were dull and
staring widely at the lofty ceiling.</p>

<p>“She wasn’t dead, then, the first glimpse you had of
her after you stopped playing?” McCarty himself did
not find it easy to continue, with that silent, dominant
presence before them.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—but she must have been, of course!
She didn’t move and there was no sign of her breath!
I can’t understand it! What frightful thing can have
stricken her?”</p>

<p>“Suppose you tell me from the beginning.” McCarty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
restrained his impatience. “How did she and the child
come here?”</p>

<p>“I was seated here alone at the organ, improvising as
I do when I am disturbed in mind, for this misfortune
to little Horace affected me deeply.” He paused as
though to collect himself, glanced again with a shudder at
the body of the young French girl and turned away.
“The room seemed overpoweringly warm and I went
to the window there and opened it wider to see Lucette
and the baby just outside, listening. The child is entranced
with music and once or twice before Lucette has
brought her in at my invitation; Mrs. Bellamy is much
amused at little Maude’s devotion to me. When I saw
them standing there I suggested that they come in and
myself opened the door for them. Lucette seated herself
there where you see her now and took the baby up on
her lap. I returned to the organ, really forgetting their
presence the moment I was seated again before it.
Handel’s ‘Largo’ came into my thoughts, although it is
scarcely the sort of thing to appeal to a child and I
played it through to the end. In the silence, as the last
notes died away, the patter of little feet running across
the marble floor recalled my guests to my mind and I
turned. Little Maude was playing about that palm over
there, trying to reach the lowest of its broad leaves
but Lucette was—as you see her. I don’t know—I can’t
recall what I thought for the moment—possibly that she
had fallen asleep or was still relaxed under the spell of
the music, but almost instantly it came to me that something
was wrong. I called her name sharply, I remember,
and hurried to her side but before I touched her
I seemed to know the truth—that she was dead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“You didn’t move her, Mr. Orbit? The position of
the body is just the same?”</p>

<p>“I raised one of her hands to feel her pulse but there
was no slightest beat beneath my fingers and I lowered
it to the bench and drew her head forward. One look
was enough and I let it roll back once more, calling for
Ching Lee. The baby had trotted over to me and I took
her up in my arms to keep her from approaching Lucette.
I think it was Jean who appeared first, but Ching
Lee came immediately after and I told him to send for
the doctor; when he came back from the telephone he
said you were passing and I had him stop you.” Orbit
passed a shaking hand once more across his forehead.
“What could have brought death to that girl, McCarty?
I’m not ignorantly superstitious but it seems as if some
horrible, malign thing were settling down over us here
in the Mall and the horror deepens! First Hughes, then
Horace’s disappearance and now this inexplicable tragedy
right under my roof, in my very presence! It is enough
to shake a man’s reason!”</p>

<p>“You’re sure you were alone in the house, with just
the servants, I mean?” McCarty had advanced to the
body again and was scrutinizing it carefully without
touching it. “Those front windows are flush with the
sidewalk but nobody could have climbed in very well
in broad daylight with the watchman patrolling the block.
How about that glass wall where it bulges out? The
lower panes open as well as the upper ones, don’t they?”</p>

<p>He pointed to the farther side of the room built out
like a huge bay-window and Orbit nodded.</p>

<p>“Of course, but they are never touched, except for an
hour on the hottest of summer days; the tropical orchids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
banked there would die instantly if a cool breeze blew over
them and the sections of glass can only be reached with
a long pole. No one could force a way through the
plants without leaving some trace or making their presence
known. There is a French window in the card-room
which is probably open and a person might enter
unseen from the court between this house and Goddard’s,
and the kitchen or tradesmen’s door may have been left
ajar.” He spoke slowly as if to himself. “The cook
is out and Jean, Ching Lee and Fu Moy are the only
others in the house besides myself. Great heavens, Sir
Philip arrives this evening! I had a wire from him!”</p>

<p>“That’s the English gentleman who’s on his way from
the West? Sir Philip Dever—something?” McCarty
recalled their conversation of the previous day.</p>

<p>“Sir Philip Devereux. He comes at a most inopportune
moment!” Orbit groaned. “This poor girl—McCarty,
there must be some rational explanation!”</p>

<p>“What did Ching Lee mean?” McCarty asked suddenly.
“When he grabbed me outside in the street there
he said Lucette had ‘breathed the breath of death.’ It
didn’t seem only a Chinese way of expressing himself.
Have you an idea what he could have been getting
at?”</p>

<p>“Is that what he said?” Orbit walked quickly over to
the nearest orchid and indicated the great distended
purple bloom shot with angry streaks of livid orange-yellow.
“There is what he meant, one of the rarest of
my specimens and a hybrid, a cross between two of the
least-known varieties of orchid in Central America. The
natives down there regard it as poison and believe that
to inhale its odor, which is rank and nauseous, means
death. There is an old superstition among them that it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
part vegetable and part animal life and that the curious
vibration of its petals—so like pulsation, do you see it?—is
the act of breathing; to smell it is to take its breath,
to die. Ching Lee heard me telling this to some guests
one evening and nothing could ever induce him to approach
it since. There is nothing in the idea, however;
the plant isn’t poisonous in any way, but I suppose that
was the first thought that occurred to his mind when he
saw Lucette lying dead.”</p>

<p>McCarty edged cautiously over toward it but footsteps
sounded in the hall and Jean presented himself
at the door.</p>

<p>“Madame Bellamy is not at home, but Snape took the
little Maude to place in the care of one of the maids,”
he reported. “He say that he will explain to Madame.—The
docteur is not come?”</p>

<p>Before Orbit or McCarty could reply the doorbell
rang and he hurried away to admit Dennis and the inspector.
The latter had evidently been prepared by his
companion, for he glanced hastily at the body and then
turned to Orbit.</p>

<p>“How long has she been dead?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; about twenty minutes I should say,
inspector. It occurred while I was playing rather a
lengthy movement on the organ and I wasn’t aware of it
until I had finished.” Orbit started as the bell pealed
again and added in relief: “That must be Doctor Allonby
now!”</p>

<p>Jean ushered in a slender, dapper man who greeted
Orbit by name, nodded with suddenly alert interest when
the inspector and his deputies were introduced and then
advanced to the body.</p>

<p>While he examined it the four grouped themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
about him, but Jean crept to the door and joined Ching
Lee who was hovering just outside. They whispered
together but the others waited in tense silence.</p>

<p>Finally the doctor straightened.</p>

<p>“This woman has been killed by the inhalation of some
gas, some poisonous fumes, but of what nature I am
unable to determine,” he announced, gazing from Orbit
to the inspector with keen incisiveness. “I have never
encountered a similar case but the symptoms admit of no
other diagnosis. They are like and yet unlike some of
those I noted on the battlefields of France a few years
ago, but undoubtedly death was induced by asphyxiation
of an exceedingly uncommon form; the autopsy will
reveal its nature.”</p>

<p>The inhalation of poisonous fumes! McCarty heard
a faint but high-pitched ejaculation in the hall, in Ching
Lee’s chattering tones. Involuntarily his eyes strayed to
the distorted, bulbous, luridly glowing orchid, which
seemed in the shadows to be moving, reaching out toward
them! Could it have been the “breath of death” indeed?
He felt the nerves crawl beneath his skin and his
scalp tingled, but the matter-of-fact voice of the inspector
recalled him to stern facts.</p>

<p>“How long would you say she’d been dead, Doctor?”</p>

<p>“Not much more than half an hour; the body is still
warm. You have taken charge here?”</p>

<p>The inspector nodded.</p>

<p>“Then I may suggest that you notify your medical
examiner without delay. I understand that this death
is—er—a mystery, Mr. Orbit?”</p>

<p>“An unaccountable one, Doctor Allonby. I was here
in the room at the time it occurred, playing the organ
over there and Lucette and the baby—this young girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
was the nurse for Mrs. Bellamy’s child next door—were
seated on this bench.”</p>

<p>The doctor started and asked quickly:</p>

<p>“The child! What has become of it?”</p>

<p>“The houseman took it home after you were summoned,”
Orbit replied.</p>

<p>“But it was unharmed? The child was seated here
beside the nurse?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” Orbit interrupted. “While I played it had
climbed down and was amusing itself over by that palm.”</p>

<p>“A miraculous escape!” the doctor exclaimed. “Had
it remained here it would undoubtedly have met with the
same death which overcame the nurse. Was that window
open just as it is now, the one directly behind those
plants back of the bench?”</p>

<p>The doctor had never taken his eyes from Orbit’s face
and it seemed to McCarty that his tones had quickened.</p>

<p>“Just as you see it now,” affirmed Orbit. “Nothing
has been disturbed or changed in any way. But, Doctor,
are you positive of your diagnosis? I am not questioning
your knowledge but this terrible affair is utterly inexplicable
to me! I heard nothing, saw no one! When I
seated myself before the organ Lucette was to all casual
appearances a perfectly normal young woman glowing
with health; when I turned from it a few minutes later
she was stretched there dead! The child was absolutely
unconcerned and I am sure she had noticed nothing; she
is a shy little creature, uneasy in the presence of strangers,
and if any one had stolen in and approached the nurse
it seems incredible that she would not have cried out or
run to me. Thank heaven she is old enough to talk, we
may be able to learn something from her later.”</p>

<p>“That is an important point,” conceded the doctor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
“When you approached the body did you notice any
peculiar odor on the air? It would have been pungent,
irritating, almost choking.—Think, Mr. Orbit! You
must have been conscious of some foreign, highly
chemicalized odor, even if it were almost instantly dissipated.”</p>

<p>There was a pause and then Orbit slowly shook his
head.</p>

<p>“I was conscious of no such odor,” he replied. “It is
odd, for I am peculiarly sensitive to things of that sort
but then I was overwhelmed with the shock of what had
taken place. As soon as I realized the girl was dead I
called the servants—they might have detected this odor
you speak of.—Jean! Ching Lee!”</p>

<p>The two advanced reluctantly from the hall, but in
answer to the physician’s queries supplemented by more
brusk ones from the inspector, they could reply only
in the negative. Jean had been polishing some brasses in
a nearby room and heard Mr. Orbit call Ching Lee; he
had thought it strange that he did not ring as usual, and
when he called again there was something in his voice
that made Jean think he needed help. He rushed in and
saw the girl stretched upon the bench and Mr. Orbit
standing there with little Maude in his arms. Ching Lee
had entered just behind him and their stammered stories
corroborated that of their employer in every detail.
They had noticed no odor but that of the plants all about
and they were quite certain they had seen no stranger
lurking in the immediate vicinity, to say nothing of getting
into the house itself. They had both been on the
lower floor all the afternoon.</p>

<p>“I live on the next street and I shall be glad to render
any assistance possible to your medical examiner,” Doctor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Allonby turned to the inspector and there was an
oddly repressed note in his tones. “I will look up this
case among my notes and try to ascertain the nature of
the chemicals used to generate the gas or vapor which
caused this young woman’s death, meanwhile holding myself
at your disposal.—Mr. Orbit, I regret that I arrived
too late to be of real service, but in any event the end
must have come almost instantaneously.”</p>

<p>He bowed, still with that guarded air of repression,
and left the room, Ching Lee accompanying him to the
door. Orbit shrugged, throwing out his hands in a hopeless
gesture.</p>

<p>“You saw? I believe the man actually thinks I am
withholding some facts from him!—But who wouldn’t?
I can’t bring myself to believe it either, even with that
poor girl’s body here before us! It is awful—awful!”</p>

<p>He sank down upon a low stone seat, resting his head
upon his hands and the inspector observed:</p>

<p>“Poison gas! That’s a new one on me, except for the
carbon monoxide generated from motor cars standing
in enclosed spaces. I never was connected with the
Bomb Squad but I thought most of that stuff had to be
exploded. You didn’t hear anything, did you, while you
were playing?”</p>

<p>“Not a sound. The ‘Largo’ is not necessarily thunderous
in volume but it has swelling chords which would
have effectually smothered any slight noise. What are
we to do now, inspector? I am in your hands.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your telephone? I’ve got to notify headquarters
and get the medical examiner. That’s the first step,
as the doctor said.... Of course I want no one to leave
this house!”</p>

<p>“Assuredly not!” Orbit lifted his head. “Ching Lee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
show Inspector Druet to the telephone and then see that
Fu Moy remains quietly upstairs until he is sent for.”</p>

<p>Ching Lee bowed and followed the official from the
room. Dennis, who had been fearfully regarding the
body of the dead girl, moved toward McCarty.</p>

<p>“By all that’s unholy, what’s doing around here!” he
whispered audibly. “Are the powers of darkness let
loose, entirely? Poison gas, my eye! Mac, how would
anybody be reaching her except with a squirt-gun or a
grenade through that window?”</p>

<p>“Who gave Hughes that poison that not one in a
thousand has ever heard of, and how was the Goddard
kid snatched from off the face of the earth?” McCarty
retorted but in a cautiously lowered tone. He had approached
the bench once more and was gazing down at
the still figure. “You remember what Ching Lee said?
Lucette was the ‘next.’ He don’t think this devilment
is goin’ to stop even here and no more do I, unless
our luck turns and we can stamp it out! This girl,
now—”</p>

<p>He paused, staring down seemingly at the small feet
encased in their neat shoes which peeped out from beneath
a fold of her skirt, and Dennis drew back with a
shiver.</p>

<p>“It turns me fair sick to look at her! To think we
was only talking to her this morning!—It seems to me
there is a kind of a funny smell on the air! Don’t you
get it, Mac? Maybe it’s something that creeps over you
gradual, and before we know it we could be corpses ourselves!
I’d like well to be out of this room!”</p>

<p>“’Tis your imagination and not that nose you brag
of that’s working now!” McCarty thrust his foot forward
in a pushing motion until his knee struck smartly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
against the edge of the stone seat on which Lucette’s body
lay. “There’s no smell whatever, barring the scent of
the flowers! Himself has been here through it all, remember.”</p>

<p>He indicated with a jerk of his head the seat where the
bowed figure rested, and at that moment the inspector
reëntered the conservatory.</p>

<p>“Mr. Orbit, is there any other entrance to this room besides
that door?”</p>

<p>Orbit looked up and then rose slowly, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>“None, but the windows are open as you see—”</p>

<p>“We’ll close and fasten them and then lock this door
behind us. I want everything in here left undisturbed
until the medical examiner comes. Take us somewhere
private where we can talk; I’ll have to get every detail
connected with this straight for my report.”</p>

<p>“My study, upstairs?” Orbit suggested.</p>

<p>“All right. Riordan, close the windows, will you, and
fix the catches?” The inspector turned and fumbled
with the key in the lock as Dennis started for the windows
and Orbit, after a last horror-stricken glance at the
dead girl, preceded the others from the room.</p>

<p>McCarty eyed his superior’s back for a moment then
stooped quickly and drew out from under the bench the
object he had carefully kicked there a minute or two before;
it was a slender stick with a wad of shrivelled, limp
blue rubber dependent from one end. Snapping the stick
he thrust it back beneath the bench again and placed the
fragment with the clinging, clammily resilient pouch in
his pocket. Then he, too, glanced once more at Lucette’s
dead face as though ratifying some agreement between
them and turned to follow his superior.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE BLUE BALLOON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Orbit</span> told of the afternoon’s tragic experience again
in detail for the inspector’s benefit and McCarty
and Dennis listened carefully, but it differed in no way
from his first description. At its conclusion the medical
examiner’s assistant was announced. The inspector descended
with Orbit but McCarty and his colleague discreetly
effaced themselves.</p>

<p>“We’re leaving just when it’s getting good!” Dennis
sighed with morbid relish as they went down the steps
and out into the lengthening shadows of late afternoon.
“I’d like to have had a good look by ourselves around that
conservatory! That doctor may be all right for the
fashionable, expensive ailments of the crowd around this
neighborhood, but I’ve been fighting fires too long not to
know what asphyxiation means and ’twas not that
killed the poor young thing in that great vault of a room
with the windows open wide behind her!—How the devil
do you suppose she did come to die, Mac?”</p>

<p>“I’m past guessing!” McCarty confessed. “’Tis the
worst case since ever I went on the Force, and we’re up
against the cleverest murdering wretch that’s been loosed
on the world! You’ll mind I told you once that brains
and not brawn was back of it all? Brains it is, with the
genius of them twisted and gone wrong, and a knowledge
of poisons and such that means the learning of a lifetime!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
We’ll slip around to the back of the house and wait till the
medical lad from headquarters has gone. I’m thinking
there’s more besides us would like a minute or two in that
conservatory!”</p>

<p>“Why?” Dennis looked startled. “Is something hid
there, do you mean? How could it be, with the servants
around all the time and Orbit right there in the room?
’Tis the first murder ever I heard of that could be pulled
off with a man playing the organ not twenty feet away
and a little child running about in the midst of it and
neither of them the wiser! There’s the baby now!”</p>

<p>They had reached the rear court and in the tradesmen’s
entrance of the Bellamy house next door a buxom housemaid
appeared with little Maude in her arms. She stood
eyeing them in undisguised curiosity and interest and
McCarty lifted his hat, approaching her with a bland
smile.</p>

<p>“Maudie’s after having a new nurse, I see!” he began
ingratiatingly. “’Tis a pity Lucette took sick back there
in Mr. Orbit’s—”</p>

<p>“How is she?” the woman interrupted. “What happened
to her? I know who you are; you’re from the
police trying to find out who killed the valet from in
there.”</p>

<p>McCarty acknowledged the recognition with a bow as
graceful as his girth permitted.</p>

<p>“You’ve got us right. We just happened to be on
hand to-day when Lucette got sick; she’d brought the
baby in to hear Mr. Orbit play and he told Jean to bring
her back home while the doctor was coming. I guess
that French girl’s pretty bad but they didn’t tell us what
was the matter with her.”</p>

<p>“Lucette!” The child had caught a familiar name.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
“Maudie wants Lucette!—Wants to hear mans play
adain!”</p>

<p>She struggled to free herself and the woman stooped
and set her on her feet but kept a careful grip on the
fluffy skirts.</p>

<p>“She’s a handful!” Her tone was exasperated. “It
was all I could do to get her quiet and now she’s started
hollering again! Lucette’s got a wonderful knack with
her, and patience too, and Maudie’s took a great fancy to
her, considering the little while she’s been here. She’s a
nice girl and I can’t think what’s ailing her, for she
was all right when she started out with the baby for a
walk this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Want to walk <em>now</em>!” Maudie announced making an
abortive dive forward. “Want to go to Lucette.”</p>

<p>“Hello, there!” McCarty held out a stubby forefinger
and Maudie looked up at him for a moment, then shyly
clasped her chubby hand about it. “What happened to
your pretty balloon?”</p>

<p>“‘Balloon?’” Her other hand went to her mouth and
she sucked her thumb reflectively.</p>

<p>“Sure,” McCarty urged encouragingly while Dennis
stared at him in surprise. “The grand blue balloon you
had. What’s become of it? Did you break it?”</p>

<p>“She had no balloon—,” the woman began, but Maudie
was of another mind.</p>

<p>“<em>Did</em> have!” she contradicted flatly. “Lucette buyed
it.”</p>

<p>“Off of a wop—I mean, a man—with a big basket full
of them down by the gate?” McCarty asked. “A big
basket with a lot of balloons, red and blue and purple
ones?”</p>

<p>Maudie nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“Big bastik!” she affirmed. “Lucette buyed balloon an’
I tooked it into the man’s house where he made the
music.”</p>

<p>She was evidently trying hard to remember and McCarty
waited but the effort proving vain he prompted:</p>

<p>“You broke the balloon while the man was making the
music, didn’t you?—When you got down off Lucette’s
lap to play around, didn’t you break the pretty balloon?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t bwoke it!” Maudie shook her curls decidedly.
“Dave it to Lucette.”</p>

<p>“Whilst the man was making the music?” McCarty
persisted.</p>

<p>“No. Lucette tooked it when we went into the man’s
house, where the garden is an’ the fing that makes the
music.—Want my balloon!”</p>

<p>The corners of the rosebud mouth drooped pitifully
and a premonitory moisture dimmed her eyes.</p>

<p>“What did Lucette do with it, do you know?”</p>

<p>The question was beyond Maudie, however, and she
could only reiterate:</p>

<p>“Want Lucette! Want my balloon!”</p>

<p>“Did Lucette have many friends here in this country,
do you think?” McCarty gave it up at last and addressed
the housemaid, who fortunately did not note that he
voiced his query in the past tense.</p>

<p>“No, she hasn’t. She’s got plenty of followers, if
that’s what you mean, but she’s real sensible for such a
young thing and don’t bother with them. She would not
have gone in Mr. Orbit’s house if that Hughes had been
alive, though; she hated the sight of him and small
blame to her!”</p>

<p>McCarty chuckled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“He was a gay lad, from all accounts! But I guess
there are others that Lucette hates too, eh? She’s kind
of afraid of somebody, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of!” The woman tossed her head as
she caught up the protesting Maudie once more. “I’ve
no call to be talking about her to a stranger, anyway!
Get along with your nonsense!”</p>

<p>McCarty laughed again good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“A bit of gossip does no harm! But we’ve work to do,
Denny and me. Good-by, Maudie!”</p>

<p>“By-by!” that young person responded graciously, and
the two departed for the Orbit house.</p>

<p>“What for were you asking the kid about the balloon?”
Dennis asked, when they were out of earshot of the
woman who still stood in the door watching them. “I
saw none anywhere near the girl’s body! How did you
know she’d bought one for the child?”</p>

<p>“What would that wop have been hanging around the
gate for, if he’d not sold one already in here and hoped
to get rid of more?” McCarty countered. “Who else
would be wanting balloons when there’s no other kid on
the block since the Burminster girl’s not back from the
country and Horace Goddard’s gone?”</p>

<p>“‘Gone,’ it is!” Dennis’ voice lowered fearfully. “I
feel it in my bones, Mac, that the boy will never turn up
alive!—There goes the car with the medical examiner’s
assistant. They’ll be sending now for the body and then
’twill be all over the neighborhood!—Who in the devil is
back of it all?”</p>

<p>“Who’ll be the next one marked for death or disappearance?”
retorted McCarty. “’Tis that has me worried
now, for the hell-hound is working faster and faster as
if the killing fever was getting the best of him. By that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
same token, that’s my one hope; that ’twill get the best of
his shrewdness and cunning, and he’ll give himself away!
That’s the question now, Denny; who’ll be the next?”</p>

<p>They reëntered the Orbit house, by way of the tradesmen’s
entrance, to find that André the cook had returned
and was visibly wrought up over the fate of his countrywoman.
His hands trembled as he shelled chestnuts for
a glacé and dire threats issued in a choked monotone from
beneath the fiercely bristling mustache.</p>

<p>“That Hughes should have been taken, perhaps it was
the hand of fate or le bon Dieu, for he was of use to no
one in the world except m’sieu, and a perfect valet is easily
found, especially among the French, but that the little
Horace should be made to disappear and now Lucette the
beautiful one is kill’—it shall be for the revenge!”</p>

<p>“You’re right, it shall!” McCarty returned grimly.
“André, do you know the Parsons’ cook across the
street?”</p>

<p>“It is a she!” André looked up with a shrug of unutterable
contempt. “A woman big like a brigadier with three
moles upon her cheek! How should she know the art of
the cuisine?—But what would you? They are of the old
bourgeoisie, these Parsons. I am not acquaint’ with the
Amazon of the three moles!”</p>

<p>“Did ever you notice the eyes of her?” McCarty asked
suddenly. “Do they be looking two ways at once?”</p>

<p>“But yes!” André stared. “It is as though she would
see behind of her. Has she, then, tell to you something
of value to your search?”</p>

<p>“She’d have to see more than just behind her to do
that, André!”</p>

<p>They left him still muttering and passed through the
pantries and down the hall toward the front, but McCarty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
drew Dennis hastily back as the doorbell sounded
vociferously.</p>

<p>“That’ll be the ambulance to take the body to the
morgue for the autopsy,” he whispered. “The medical
examiner’s assistant must have ’phoned for it before he
left, that it’s here so quick. We’ll just be laying low till
it’s gone.”</p>

<p>“And we’ve no chance for another look at the corpse!”
Dennis mourned.</p>

<p>“What for? ’Twould help us none and ’tis not from
what’s already happened we’ll find out the truth, but from
what’s maybe coming! It’s as well to have the poor
thing’s body out of the way.”</p>

<p>In silence, then, they listened to the heavy tramp of
feet, but when the front door had closed once more McCarty
beckoned to his companion and started for the
conservatory. Its door stood wide, the windows had
been flung open again and a slight breeze which had
sprung up stirred and rustled the leaves of the palms,
but nowhere did there remain any sign of the tragedy
so recently enacted.</p>

<p>Walking over to the organ McCarty scrutinized it
critically and then seating himself on the stool before it
with his back to the instrument and hands outspread on
his knees, he regarded the marble bench on which Lucette
had met her death while Dennis shifted from foot to foot
watching him. All at once, with a grunt, he doubled
forward and appeared to be peering at the space beneath
the bench.</p>

<p>“Nothing’s under there.” Dennis’ eyes had followed
the direction of his gaze. “The floor’s bare and clean
as the palm of your hand. What more is there here for
us to see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“Not a thing, now,” McCarty replied. Nevertheless
he crossed to the windows and examined the sills before
leading the way from the room.</p>

<p>In the hall they met Orbit. There were deep lines
graven on his face by the shock and strain of the afternoon’s
horror and he was holding himself in such deep
repression that only his eyes betrayed his emotion, glowing
darkly like live coals in an ashen pallor.</p>

<p>“It is—all over?” he asked in a hushed tone. “Jean
tells me the body has been removed and the conservatory
thrown open again. I would gladly close it forever, I
feel that I can never touch the organ, but I suppose that
is morbid. Whatever mysterious, horrible thing came
to destroy that girl we can be thankful that the baby escaped!
Your inspector is quite beyond his depth, I am
afraid, but have you and Riordan no clue?”</p>

<p>“Did the medical examiner’s assistant say it was poison
gas did it, the same as the doctor?” McCarty evaded the
question.</p>

<p>“He didn’t express an opinion while I was there, but
your inspector went away with him, perhaps for some
data that may reveal the actual cause of poor Lucette’s
death. With all respect to Doctor Allonby I cannot
convince myself that the girl was gassed; the sheer
impossibility of it under the circumstances can’t be
overcome in my mind!—But don’t let me keep you, unless,
of course, there are some questions you wish to ask
me?”</p>

<p>“Not now,” McCarty shook his head. “We’ll be back
later, likely. You’ve my own ’phone number in case
anything turns up?”</p>

<p>Orbit nodded and himself showed them out the front
door. Bill Jennings met them as they approached the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
east gate and launched into excited queries concerning
the murder but McCarty cut him short.</p>

<p>“You know as much about it as we do, ourselves,” he
asserted. “The girl died sudden, sitting in the conservatory
with the child playing around her feet and not
even the doctor’s sure what took her.—Bill, do you mind
that balloon peddler you chased away from the gate when
we were coming in? Did you ever see him hanging
about before?”</p>

<p>“Many a time,” returned the watchman promptly.
“Balloons are a new line with him; it used to be peanuts
and before that little plaster images. Tony, his name
is,—he knows this boy coming now, that delivers the
evening papers for the whole Mall. Is there anything
wrong about him? He ain’t ever been inside the gates
while I was on!”</p>

<p>“Lord, no!” McCarty replied hastily. “I thought he
looked kind of like a dago I used to know myself....
Don’t let any reporters in, Bill, until we get back.”</p>

<p>He hurried through the gate, dragging Dennis after
him, and around the corner, where he came to a halt.</p>

<p>“I want a word with that paper-boy,” he explained.
“Happen he’ll give us a line on this Tony; we’ll collar him
as he goes back.”</p>

<p>“Balloons again!” Dennis exclaimed in disgust. “Well
I know you’ll not talk till your own good time but ’tis
in your mind that a balloon had something to do with that
girl’s death! I’d better be getting back to the engine
house, laying up some good sleep against to-morrow,
for it’s small use I’ll be while you keep me in the dark!”</p>

<p>“I’m in the dark myself, Denny,” McCarty confessed
in contrition. “’Tis only a wild guess on my part, but
I’ve a busted toy balloon in my pocket that I picked up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
from the floor of that conservatory right foreninst Lucette’s
feet after the doctor had gone. I don’t know has
it anything to do with the case but ’twas the gas that balloons
are sometimes filled with that put me in mind of it.
I broke the stick off it and threw it under the bench and
when we went back just now it was gone.”</p>

<p>Dennis’ jaw dropped.</p>

<p>“But how in the world could gas, poisoned or no, be
put into it—?” he began. “I never heard tell of the
like—!”</p>

<p>“Wisht! The lad’s coming now!” McCarty cautioned,
then stepped forward. “Hey, just a minute, sonny!
Where’ll I find your friend Tony, him that sells toy balloons?
I saw him around here this afternoon and I want
to get a dozen or so off him for an entertainment. Bill
Jennings, the watchman there at the Mall, said you could
tell me.”</p>

<p>The boy, an olive-skinned lad with soft, dark eyes and
a shy, ingratiating smile, pushed his cap farther back on
his curly black hair.</p>

<p>“Tony Primavera?” he nodded. “He ought ter be
t’roo bus’ness fer de day now but youse can find him
over where he lives wid Joe de ice-man, in a basement on
Thoid Avenyer near Eightieth. He’ll have his stock dere
wid him, too!”</p>

<p>Thanking their informant they started east to the
avenue indicated, and up along that teeming thoroughfare
to Eightieth Street where they readily found the
steep basement stairs with the sign outside that orders
for coal and ice would be taken below.</p>

<p>With Dennis close behind McCarty descended to the
dark half-cellar, lighted dimly by a single flaring gas-jet.
Besides the table and broken backed chairs, two cots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
covered with soiled blankets and a stove on which a pot
bubbled and gave forth a strong aroma of garlic denoted
that the apartment served for living as well as business
purposes, but their eyes were caught primarily by the
huge basket in the corner bristling with toy balloons so
that it seemed a miracle it was not lifted from the floor
by its aerial freight.</p>

<p>“Are they the same he had with him this afternoon?”
asked Dennis.</p>

<p>“If they are he’s not sold many,” responded McCarty.
“Where’s he gone, I wonder? ’Tis a grand sight we’ll
be, trailing them through the streets across town, but I’m
going to find out what’s inside of every last one of them
this night!”</p>

<p>Dennis betrayed acute symptoms of alarm.</p>

<p>“What if we find what we’re looking for and the two
of us keel over?” he demanded. “If you’ll listen to me
for once, Mac, we’ll take them up to the Park in the fine
fresh air and bu’st them with rocks—thrown! I’m not
saying we’ve done such a hell of a lot so far in this investigation
but we’d do less laid out cold and stiff!”</p>

<p>“Well do the spell-binders—of the losing party—tell
us the town is going to the devil when we depend on the
likes of you, that’s afraid of a child’s toy, to protect us if
we drop a cigarette or coax the stove along with a bit of
kerosene!” retorted McCarty, adding with naïve inconsistency:
“That wop ain’t carting poison gas around with
him in ten-cent balloons, but I’m going to be sure, anyhow.”</p>

<p>A clatter on the steps interrupted the debate and the
swarthy vendor of the afternoon appeared with a round,
porous loaf and a pale, bulbous cheese unwrapped beneath
his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“Joe’s out.” He jerked his thumb toward the table.
“Write da ord’ on da slate an’ bime-by he bring it.”</p>

<p>“’Tis not coal nor ice we want, Tony, but some of your
balloons, a lot of them,” McCarty replied. “You know
the kid that delivers the papers over at the New Queen’s
Mall? He told us where to find you, for they’re giving a
child’s party where we work and we’ve got to have the
balloons right away.”</p>

<p>“How many?” Tony deposited the bread and cheese on
the table with a thump and proceeded eagerly to business.
“Fine-a balloon, only fifteen-a cent—!”</p>

<p>“A dime was what you were asking this afternoon
and a dime you’ll get now!” McCarty announced with
decision. “How many have you there?”</p>

<p>The Italian shrugged philosophically and counted on
his grimy fingers.</p>

<p>“Twenta-two.” He looked up with a grimace.
“Bad-a biz to-day!”</p>

<p>“We’ll take the lot,” declared his customer. “Tie the
stems of them together in two bunches if you can.
Here’s your money.”</p>

<p>The bargain was soon concluded and they sallied forth
with their burden, but it excited so much comment,
chiefly of a humorous nature, that McCarty himself was
glad to subside in the depths of a taxi encountered on a
side-street.</p>

<p>“Don’t sit all over me!” he warned his companion irritably
as they started anew. “You’ll be bu’sting the
damn things before we get home! Is it grinning the
chauffeur is, the blockhead?”</p>

<p>“’Tis two lunatics he thinks he’s driving!” Dennis
averred gloomily. “He’d grin with the other side of his
mouth if he knew he was carrying a load of sudden death,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
maybe!—I’ll thank you to move over yourself, Timothy
McCarty, and not be poking them gas-bags in my
face!”</p>

<p>Thereafter conversation languished until they drew up
before the door of McCarty’s rooms. Monsieur Girard,
the dealer in antiques, came to the door of his shop and
raised his withered hands heaven-ward at this latest
demonstration of his neighbor’s eccentricity, but McCarty
vouchsafed him only a curt nod and then followed Dennis,
who was gingerly ascending the stairs, guarding his cargo
with almost maternal solicitude.</p>

<p>In the living-room he deposited it in the middle of the
floor and opened the windows wide before turning on the
light. The balloons rose slowly ceilingward in a variegated
cluster and he made a wild dive to secure them.</p>

<p>“Tie your bunch to the arm of the chair,” McCarty
directed. “We’ll start with mine. Hold them till I get
out my pen-knife and jab it into one.”</p>

<p>Dennis shut his eyes tightly and holding his breath extended
his long arm until the joints cracked but a sharp
pop like the shot of a miniature revolver made him gasp,
forgetting his caution. He opened his eyes to behold
one of the balloons hanging, a mere deflated wisp, at the
end of its stick.</p>

<p>“Nothing but plain air,” McCarty commented. “’Tis
not gassed you are, is it, Denny?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” replied Dennis with a palpable reservation.
“You’ve twenty-one left, though!”</p>

<p>“We’ll make short work of them!” McCarty jabbed a
second balloon with his knife and the ensuing report was
productive of a like harmless result.</p>

<p>Thereafter the air was for a space filled with a rapid
succession of small detonations. When it was over and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
not a balloon was left intact Dennis’ apprehension gave
place to disgust.</p>

<p>“’Tis in our second childhood we are!” he declared.
“Whatever put it into your head that the toy balloon had
anything to do with the girl’s death——!”</p>

<p>But McCarty was not listening. He had drawn from
his pocket the shrivelled shred of rubber on its fragment
of stick and was smoothing it out thoughtfully between
his fingers. All at once he straightened.</p>

<p>“Denny, that first balloon we stuck the knife into was
red, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Sure it was!” Denny looked his surprise.</p>

<p>“And the second was blue and the third green?”</p>

<p>“I disremember,—but what of it?”</p>

<p>“Look at them! Stretch them out and see if they’ve
changed color since!” McCarty’s tones shook with excitement
and Dennis caught the infection. He drew the limp
rubber out and scrutinized each torn balloon in turn, then
shook his head.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing different about them that I can see!
What are you getting at?”</p>

<p>“Just this! When I picked this up it was blue, as blue
as that second one we broke, and look at it now!” The
rubber wisp he held out was a greenish-gray mottled with
brown spots which were already disintegrating.
“Denny, the others didn’t change color because ’twas just
air they were filled with but this is different; it’s rotting
before our eyes! ’Twas this child’s toy held the poison
gas that killed Lucette!”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> litter of wrecked balloons was cleared away and
the one which had changed color with such sinister
significance was carefully deposited in an empty tin
cracker box. With pipe and cigar alight Dennis and
McCarty were discussing the latest development, their
fatigue forgotten in their renewed zeal.</p>

<p>“There’s an old guy I know living far uptown that’s
a wizard about chemistry,” McCarty observed, neglecting
to mention that the “wizard” had an interesting police
record. “I’ll take the box with what’s left of that blue
balloon in it up to him, come morning, but we’ll not
breathe a word of it to another living soul! ’Tis somebody
on the Mall or with easy access to it that’s walking
around with two murders and a disappearance on the
conscience of him, maybe giving us fair words every day
and the grand laugh behind our backs. We don’t know
who it is and till we do we’ll be telling nothing to any of
them.”</p>

<p>“True for you!” Dennis nodded. “I’m thinking,
though, ’tis on the north side of the street you’ll find your
man, Mac, for everything that’s happened hit the three
households on the south side; Orbit’s valet and Goddard’s
son and now Mrs. Bellamy’s nurse-girl. The only two
houses opposite that are occupied, since the Burminsters
are still away, are Five and Seven—the Sloanes’ and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
Parsons’. We’ll not be forgetting that Swede Otto who
beat it away from the Sloanes’ at the first alarm and
we’ve not so much as crossed the doorsill there yet.
Then there’s the Parsons, too. They hold themselves
better than their neighbors and have them that are next
to royalty, no less, for company and still and all they have
an ex-convict and suspected poisoner at that to buttle for
them. If I was that ambassador I’d have thought twice
before I stayed to lunch!”</p>

<p>“They’ve a houseful of crooks, ‘ex’ or no,” McCarty
asserted, regarding his cigar thoughtfully. “I got Porter
right, but ’twas the inspector first gave me the wire
without knowing it when he said the housemaid and page
boy looked familiar, as if he’d seen them somewhere before
but couldn’t place them. Where would he have seen
them, if ’twas not at headquarters or on trial? André
put the last touch to it this afternoon, though.”</p>

<p>“Orbit’s cook?”</p>

<p>“He did that. Do you mind when I asked him if he
knew the cook over at Parsons’ he said it was a ‘she,’ a
great big woman with three moles on her cheek? Jennie
Malone shoved about twenty thousand dollars’ worth
of the queer in the best stores of the city for the Carpenter
counterfeiting gang before she was pinched. She’d
never have been caught at all if it hadn’t been for those
three moles that gave her away. Ever since André tipped
me off I’ve been asking myself what was the rest of that
household like, and did they have more reasons than
one for keeping the neighbors at arm’s length?”</p>

<p>Dennis sat forward suddenly and took his pipe from
his mouth.</p>

<p>“Do you mean the Parsonses themselves are not on the
level?” he demanded. “The old gentleman, with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
grand charities and his pious talk, the old maid sister and
the young niece? Do you think the old gentleman is
cracked, maybe, and turned murderer wholesale? Is it
him that’s planted a hotbed of crime right there in the
Mall?”</p>

<p>“Somebody has,” McCarty shrugged. “Of course the
two murders happened in Orbit’s house, if ’twas there
Hughes got his dose of Calabar bean, and the Goddard
kid disappeared from next door—”</p>

<p>Dennis snorted.</p>

<p>“Would Orbit be killing the valet that give him perfect
service all these years till he can’t so much as put on
his own shirt for himself, no less murdering a nurse-girl,
and running off with a boy? None in the Bellamy
household could have had a hand in Lucette’s death and
it stands to reason Goddard didn’t kidnap his own son!
Orbit’s likely to be under fire now and come in for a
lot of notoriety and maybe—well, there’s others under
that roof besides himself!”</p>

<p>“I’ve been turning that over in my mind, too.” McCarty
took a last pull at his cigar and laid the stub in the
tray. “We’ve put in this evening so far breaking balloons
and that’s about all we’ve been doing since first this
case started; opening up one gas-bag after another and
getting nothing but empty air! I’d like a chance to go
through the Parsons house and Orbit’s too, with no one
the wiser, and if you were not such a clumsy, heavy-footed
galoot, Denny, we’d be paying them a little visit
to-night without leaving our cards.”</p>

<p>“‘Clumsy,’ is it!” Dennis repeated indignantly. “Me
that’s been scaling walls and ladders since you tramped
your first beat! We’ve broke in an empty house there in
broad day and we can get in the others at night just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
easy, in spite of what newfangled burglar alarms they
may have. I’m on to most of them through fighting fires,
thanks be! Since the first night we went through those
gates I’ve felt in the soul of me that sooner or later we’d
be marauding in there like a couple of second-story
workers and now it’s come! If instead of Parsons and
his convicts it should be one of those Frenchmen or the
Chink in Orbit’s house, we’ll spot him!”</p>

<p>“The first thing we spot will be the restaurant around
the corner. ’Tis near ten o’clock and we’ve had no dinner,”
McCarty rejoined. “We won’t be showing up
near the Mall till midnight or after and we’ve a lot to
plan first.”</p>

<p>Their meal finished they returned again to the
rooms. McCarty paused for a moment in the doorway
of the living-room, a peculiar expression crossing his
face.</p>

<p>“Sit you down and light your pipe, Denny.” He
threw open the closet door as he spoke. “I’ll be with
you in a minute. Now where—?”</p>

<p>He left the closet and went into the bedroom. Dennis
paused in the act of tamping his pipe to listen open-mouthed,
for an unaccustomed sound came to his ears.
McCarty was whistling, wheezily and off-key, but there
was something oddly reminiscent in the simple, insistently
reiterated measure; moreover McCarty never indulged
in that or any other form of melodious expression
unless in a blatant attempt at dissimulation. What was
he doing, anyway, that he didn’t want his own pal to get
on to? He’d opened and shut the door of his clothes-closet
and now he was in the bathroom, still trying to
whistle that funny little tune, almost like the ones Molly’s
kid learned at the kindergarten!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>Dennis returned to his pipe, as McCarty reëntered the
room.</p>

<p>“Did you find what you were looking for?” he asked.</p>

<p>McCarty reddened.</p>

<p>“I did not, but no matter,” he replied shortly. “I unearthed
an old kit of burglars’ tools that I took once off
of Black Matt, that’ll maybe come in handy and here’s
a revolver for you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve no use for it!” remarked Dennis hastily, regarding
the weapon with small favor. “Something short and
hefty is more in my line, with no trigger to go off unexpected
and send me to the chair!”</p>

<p>“Do you think I’d trust you with it if it was loaded?”
his host retorted. “’Tis only to throw a bluff if we’re
cornered. We’ll be wearing handkerchiefs over our faces
like movie burglars, for whatever comes we don’t want
to be recognized. It don’t matter what tracks we leave
behind us as long as we get clear ourselves so we’ll take
these nippers to cut every wire we see.”</p>

<p>“And to-morrow there’ll be a new job for us, tracking
our own selves!” Dennis grinned, and then his face
sobered. “We’ve the hardest job on our hands that ever
we tackled, Mac, with this inhuman devil to lay low!”</p>

<p>“I’ve a creepy feeling that there’s more than him at
work.” McCarty dropped the tools he had been sorting
and stared reflectively into space. “I don’t know how
to put it, but it seems as if there was something powerful
and as evil as a spirit from Hell itself that’s helping
the wretch in his destruction! He’s getting bolder,
Denny, he’ll over-reach himself yet. If we could figure
who’s to be the next we could close in on him!”</p>

<p>“’Tis too deep for me.” Dennis shook his head. “Is
there a glass-cutter and a lump of putty in that layout?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>For more than an hour they discussed the forthcoming
adventure. At midnight they left the apartment and took
a roundabout way across town to the New Queen’s Mall.
Waiting until Dave Hollis, the night watchman, had
strolled to the other end of the block, they let themselves
in at the west gate and slipped into the court between
the Burminster mansion and the Sloanes’ smaller residence
next door. The original plan had been to visit
Orbit’s house first, but a light still glowed from the lower
floor, indicating that the host and his guest, Sir Philip
Devereux, had not yet retired. The Parsons establishment,
however, was decorously dark, and they proceeded
to its rear. There they paused to adjust handkerchiefs
over the lower part of their faces and Dennis took stock
of the situation. There was no moon and even the stars
were partly obscured by scudding clouds, while the rising
wind that swirled through the alley-like spaces between
the houses betokened a coming storm.</p>

<p>“’Tis the equinox, no less, that’s on the way!” Dennis
shivered more from nervousness than chill and his
voice came in a muffled whisper from beneath the handkerchief.
The flashlight in his hand wavered as he directed
its ray against the house wall. “Look at that,
now! If the old gentleman keeps any valuables here he
must think that the crooks under his roof are enough
protection from them outside, for he’s still depending on
the old Kip electric system, that a babe in arms could
disconnect!... Get you to the mouth of the alley, Mac,
and keep an eye out for the watchman.”</p>

<p>McCarty obeyed. When, after an interval during
which Hollis had passed twice, he heard a cautious hiss
behind him and returned, it was to observe loose wires
dangling innocuously from the wall and a yawning aperture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
in one of the windows where Dennis had removed
a whole pane of glass.</p>

<p>“I made a good job of it,” the latter whispered complacently.
“The telephone is cut, too, and the inside
burglar attachment. The old gentleman’s not such a
fool after all, for he’s got an installation that once set
would warn him if a window or outside door was touched,
but I put it out of business. Take off your shoes like
I did and then come on; I’ve fixed the catch already.”</p>

<p>He raised the window inch by inch while McCarty removed
his shoes, tied the laces together and hung them
about his neck. Then Dennis crawled over the sill, drew
his bulkier companion in after him and flashed his light
quickly about.</p>

<p>“There’s the door. You said not to bother with any
rooms downstairs except the old gentleman’s private
study or sitting-room if he’s got one, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I can see the foot of the back stairs at the end
of this hall, so shut off that light!” McCarty whispered
in response. “You’re breathing loud enough to wake the
dead!”</p>

<p>They fumbled their way to the stairs and up. The
silence was oppressive and to the amateur house-breakers
it seemed to hold an ever-increasing menace. They
padded along in their stockinged feet through the wide
hall, pausing at each doorway as McCarty directed his
own electric torch within, but only stately drawing-rooms
and a dining-hall huge enough for a banquet met their
gaze.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you think he’d buy more furniture?” McCarty
forgot their equivocal situation for the moment as
he gazed disparagingly down a long portrait gallery,
where Cavalier and Puritan forebears of the Parsons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
family looked down upon a few chairs placed at wide
intervals against the wall. “There are not seats enough
in all the parlors to hold a decent funeral and what there
is is old and dull like the junk in Girard’s antique shop!”</p>

<p>“Maybe ’tis worth as much and more,” Dennis suggested
sagely. “I’m not facing jail this minute, though,
for a chance to look at it!—There’s a smaller room beyond
that might be the old gentleman’s study.”</p>

<p>He had guessed truly, though the apartment in which
they found themselves more closely resembled a business
office. A roll-top desk, a swivel chair, filing cases and
a solidly compact safe met their gaze; the rugs, the upholstered
furniture and tall bookcases which completed the
appointments formed merely an incongruous background.</p>

<p>“Unless you’re up in safe-blowing, which I doubt, I
don’t see as this room is going to tell us anything!” Dennis
remarked. “Them keys that you stuffed your
pockets with will do no good.”</p>

<p>“Won’t they?” McCarty chuckled grimly and strode
toward the nearest filing case. “Hold your light steady,
Denny; fireproof this thing may be, but all the sections
of it open with the one lock and I could pick it with a
buttonhook!”</p>

<p>The lock confirmed his opinion by yielding to the third
key tried, and the various sections filled with an orderly
arrangement of ledgers and documents were at their disposal.</p>

<p>“Look at the fine, neat writing of him.” Dennis was
rummaging in the topmost one. “What’s this? ’Tis a
lot of typed stuff with his own notes on the margin and
headed: ‘Report. Chris Porter, 1913-1920.’ He’s wrote
under it: ‘Reasonable doubt. Pardon essential’; then,
‘Pardon granted, help needed.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>“Give it to me!” McCarty demanded. “Are there any
more like it? These ledgers have nothing in them but
notes on charity cases.”</p>

<p>“Here’s another; something about a reformatory, and
in his own writing: ‘Weak not vicious. Useful if right
influence.’ It’s headed: ‘Danny Sayre, 17.’—This one
is about that Jennie Malone—”</p>

<p>“Let me have them all!” McCarty interrupted. “Don’t
you see what they are? The criminal records of all the
hired help! Take the next section, after.”</p>

<p>A pause broken only by the rustling of papers ensued
and then Dennis exclaimed in an awestruck whisper:</p>

<p>“Mac! Here’s a lot of notes about ways of killing,
all mixed up with religion, and—and among ’em’s poison
gas! Fluorine, hydrogen and H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>—!”</p>

<p>“Grab it!” McCarty hastily thrust the documents he had
been examining into his pockets and closed the filing case.
“Grab all the notes and come along; we’ll need look no
further in this house!”</p>

<p>Yet on the way to the door he paused and ran the pin-point
of light along the rows of books in their towering
cases. They appeared to be volumes of reference on
widely diversified subjects, from hygiene and sanitation
to law and religion; all were arranged in meticulous order,
save on a lower shelf where the huge tomes of an encyclopædia
had been stacked helter-skelter. One volume,
that labeled: “Bronze—Cephalaspis,” protruded from
the row as though too hastily replaced and McCarty
stooped on a sudden impulse and drew it out. The morocco
covers fell apart and the book opened midway,
where a thin, silvery, leaf-shaped object had been inserted
as a mark.</p>

<p>At a muttered injunction Dennis held his light trained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
upon it and McCarty’s eyes traveled down the page then
stopped and for a long minute there was no sound except
their mingled breaths. Then the latter whispered:</p>

<p>“Listen, Denny; here’s a queer one!—‘It is used in the
form of an emulsion by the natives of Africa, as an ordeal
when persons are suspected of witchcraft. It is believed
that if the suspect vomits it he is innocent; if it is retained
and death occurs, he is guilty.’”</p>

<p>“A mighty sensible arrangement, considering!” Dennis
commented. “If he’s guilty, and I’d not put witchcraft
past them heathen, they’re saved the bother and expense
of an execution!... But what in the name of common
sense has it got to do with what’s been going on here in
the Mall?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.” McCarty tore out the page, wrapped it
about the leaf-like bookmark and pocketed it. “Nothing
whatever, except that the stuff they make the suspects
take is Calabar bean!”</p>

<p>He replaced the mutilated volume and they stole from
the room, making their way down the stairs and back to
the open window, through which they had entered. The
silence was unbroken and when they had crawled through
the aperture and out into the wind-swept court McCarty
leaned against the wall balancing himself precariously on
one foot as he drew on a shoe, while Dennis softly
closed the window.</p>

<p>“We’ll not be breaking into Orbit’s?” the latter asked,
as he followed his companion’s example. “Them notes
about poison gas, the marked page telling of Calabar
bean, and the life history of the crooks he surrounds himself
with—if Benjamin Parsons isn’t the man we’re looking
for I’ll eat my hat!”</p>

<p>“Then maybe you’d better be working up an appetite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
against the future!” suggested McCarty dryly. “There’s
no more proof against him than there was against that
Otto Lindholm and if the lights are out over at Orbit’s
I’m going to take a chance!”</p>

<p>The miniature palace across the way was in total darkness,
but its marble front gleamed whitely in the faint
glimmer of starlight before a wind-driven cloud obscured
them again. Once more escaping the vigilance of the
night watchman they crossed the street and passed down
the opening next to the Goddard house where the glow
from all the upper windows bore mute testimony once
more to the sustained anxiety and heartbreaking suspense
within.</p>

<p>McCarty halted his companion before the little side
door.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait here while you go around back and cut any
wires you find,” he directed. “The bulge of the conservatory
hides me from the street and ’tis not likely any
of the Goddard household will be looking out their windows.
What with the murder and then company and
all, Ching Lee may have forgot to fasten this door proper
on the inside, and we can force it easier than the iron
grill outside the rear windows. Don’t be all night,
Denny!”</p>

<p>Dennis glanced rather dubiously up at the next house,
then out to the sidewalk, but he hurried away without a
word and McCarty took out his keys and waited.</p>

<p>The strangely coincidental facts he had unearthed in
Benjamin Parsons’ study gave him much food for reflection,
but long experience made him more wary of
jumping to conclusions than his optimistic colleague.
Parsons was known as an eminent and practical philanthropist;
what if he’d taken those ex-convicts into his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
home to reform them at first hand? It would be natural
enough for him to keep reports on their past records.
Calabar bean had been prominently mentioned in the
papers in connection with the murder of his neighbor’s
valet; mightn’t he have been interested sufficiently to look
it up as a rarity? The notes on poison gas “mixed up
with religion” were more difficult to explain, but then
only Dennis had seen them yet and—where the devil was
Denny, anyway?</p>

<p>McCarty craned his neck to stare into the darkness toward
the rear but no deeper shadow moved and no sound
came to him but the moaning swish of the wind. Denny
had maybe found a burglar alarm that it wasn’t so easy
to put out of business!</p>

<p>Hollis pounded heavily past on the sidewalk, then returned
and went on again and still there was no sign of
his erstwhile companion. All at once the bolts of the
door against which he leaned were drawn back and McCarty
had barely time to spring aside and flatten himself
in the corner of the out-curving glass conservatory
wall when the door itself swung inward.</p>

<p>He held his breath but no one appeared. At last a
low hiss assailed his ears.</p>

<p>“’Tis you!” Mingled relief and exasperation lent emphasis
to his whispered ejaculation. “For what did you
play such a damn fool trick? I near landed on the flat
of my back—”</p>

<p>“Forget it!” Denny interrupted with unaccustomed
tone. “Come on in before the watchman passes again!
You’d never have got past these bolts only I found a
way in through the little pantry ventilator; you couldn’t
have squeezed through it in a year!—Now, which way?
Is it up to the floor where the Frenchmen and them two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
heathen sleep that we’ll be going? Nobody’s stirring.”</p>

<p>He had closed the door and noiselessly shot the bolt.
McCarty responded:</p>

<p>“I want to make sure; Orbit said he wasn’t a good
sleeper, you’ll remember, and if he could rest easy in his
bed this night, with that poor girl murdered under his
roof not so many hours past, he’s not the man I took him
for! We’ll go up the back stairs and then sneak along
the hall to his door. Thanks be, we know the lay of this
house!”</p>

<p>They crept silently through the card-room and past the
pantries to the back stairs, where they stopped and removed
their shoes again before venturing upward. No
faintest ray of light shone from under any door on the
floor above, but from behind one on the left deep and
regular stertorous sounds denoted that one at least of the
household, doubtless the distinguished arrival of the previous
evening, slumbered, unhaunted by morbid visions.</p>

<p>Before the door of Orbit’s own bedroom they halted
but no sound came from within and at length McCarty
motioned to his companion and tiptoed into the sitting-room
adjoining.</p>

<p>“You’ve been in that bedroom before.” His lips barely
formed the words close to Dennis’ ear. “You’ll know
how the furniture’s placed, so as not to fall over it. Go
in and see is he asleep; I’ve our story all fixed if he
should jump you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve not!” Dennis retorted in palpable reluctance.
“Moreover there’s a queer, sweetish smell on the air;
don’t you get it? If he or anything else in there jumps
me I hope you’ll get busy first and explain afterwards!”</p>

<p>He left McCarty’s side and the latter heard his feet
pad softly off toward the connecting door between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
rooms. A pause ensued, then came the footsteps again
but fainter now. After a moment a low light flashed.
It wavered, steadied, went out suddenly and a dull thud
came to McCarty’s ears as the electric torch itself struck
the thick pile of the rug. He started forward as Dennis’
low, shaking voice was borne upon the silence.</p>

<p>“For the love of the saints, come here, Mac! Somebody’s
been before us!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<span class="fs80">A QUESTION ANSWERED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">For</span> an instant McCarty’s stout legs wabbled beneath
him, then he drew himself together and pressing the
button of his own flashlight he strode over the sill.</p>

<p>A strange scene presented itself to his staring eyes.
Dennis was clinging weakly to an upright post at the
foot of the heavily carved bed upon which Orbit was
lying. His firmly molded chin was relaxed and the
sunken, closed eyes were mere blotches of shadow in the
grayish pallor of his face. The pajama jacket was open
at his throat and his arms were flung above his head as
though helplessness had come upon him in the effort to
protect himself from an attack. As he noted these things
McCarty became aware of the pungent, sweetish odor
that assailed his own nostrils.</p>

<p>“Chloroform!” he gasped, pointing to a small bottle
which stood upon the bedstand. “Isn’t that a towel
on the pillow beside his head? Throw it into the
corner, Denny, and then get back into the other room,
quick!”</p>

<p>Galvanized into life Dennis obeyed, retrieving his flashlight
as he went. McCarty waited only long enough to
open the two windows wide before rejoining him.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we going to raise an alarm?” Dennis demanded
excitedly, but McCarty lowered his own voice to a whisper
once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“We are not, to get ourselves accused! We’re going
to beat it out the way we came as fast as the Lord’ll let
us. Don’t open your mouth again till we get beyond the
gates! Sure, the devil himself is let loose!”</p>

<p>Down the stairs they went, through the pantries and
lower front hall to the card-room. The distance seemed
interminable and every footstep resounded maddeningly
in their nerve-shaken ears, but they did not pause until
they reached the little side door and Dennis had shot the
bolts back.</p>

<p>“Wait till we put on our shoes again,” McCarty admonished.
“There’s no room to do it out in that alley
and we’re safe enough now, but hurry!”</p>

<p>Shod once more, they stole out, closing the door noiselessly
behind them. The watchman had passed on in the
direction of the east gate and they sped to the opposite
one, passing through it just before he turned.</p>

<p>All desire for speech seemed to have left Dennis and
they walked northward for several blocks before McCarty
broke the silence.</p>

<p>“I suppose you think ’twas queer we didn’t take that
heaven-sent opportunity to search the house without
Orbit, at least, to interrupt us, Denny, but there was no
telling how long he’d been under that chloroform nor
when he’d come out of it, and we could not say we’d
scared away whoever did it to him or we would not
have sneaked in ourselves.”</p>

<p>“How do you know he wasn’t dead?” Dennis’ tone
held a volume of reproach.</p>

<p>“I saw the chest of him rise and fall regular with his
breathing, and a whiff like that could not put him out
for the count!” McCarty declared impatiently. “Didn’t
I open the windows on him myself, and tell you to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
away the towel that must have slipped down from off
his face?”</p>

<p>“’Twas still damp with that stuff!” Dennis muttered
with a shudder.</p>

<p>“And chloroform evaporates quicker than anything
else I know!” exclaimed his companion. “That shows it
must have been given to him the minute, almost, before
we went upstairs! The sitting-room looked all right to
me; did you happen to notice whether anything was upset
or not where he was?”</p>

<p>“I did not!” Dennis averred. “I’d the shock of my
life when my light flashed over his face! If he’s found
dead come morning I’ll feel as if I’d murdered him myself
and not a wink will I sleep nor a free breath will I
draw till I know he’s all right!”</p>

<p>But when McCarty’s rooms were reached again and
the desultory discussion was renewed it was Dennis himself
in whom exhausted nature first was revealed and he
sank deeply into healthy slumber. His host, however, sat
hunched in his armchair till dawn, smoking innumerable
cigars and staring through narrowed eyes into the turbid
atmosphere of the familiar room as though he beheld
strange and evil things.</p>

<p>Finally he stretched himself out wearily beside Dennis
and dropped into an uneasy slumber, to be awakened by
the sharp ringing of the telephone. When he turned
from it, after receiving the frenzied message, it was to
find his guest draped in his own shabby bathrobe, waiting
with morbid expectancy for the news.</p>

<p>“Is Orbit dead—?”</p>

<p>“He is not! He’s got the inspector fair wild with his
tale of being drugged in the night and on top of it old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
Benjamin Parsons reports a robbery! Both the watchmen
are fired temporarily and lads from headquarters
put in their place,” McCarty retorted succinctly. “It’s
a nice, peaceful day you’ll be having of it at the fire house
while I face the music!”</p>

<p>Dennis gulped with relief.</p>

<p>“Was anything took from Orbit’s house, did the inspector
say?”</p>

<p>“He’d no time, but I’m thinking he’ll be on his way
here as soon as he can pacify the two latest victims of
outrage there in the Mall. Moreover, if you’re going to
stop for Brian to shave you after breakfast, it will be a
miracle that you’re not late for duty!”</p>

<p>Dennis disappeared promptly into the bathroom and
McCarty gathered up the documents and the page torn
from the encyclopædia purloined from the Parsons house,
and stowed them carefully away before making his own
hasty toilet. They ate a sketchy breakfast together at
the accustomed restaurant and then separated, McCarty
returning to his rooms with a sheaf of newspapers to
await the coming of his superior.</p>

<p>From the front page of the first paper the pictured face
of Horace Goddard stared out at him, big-eyed and wistfully
alert, and the caption beneath announced that Mr.
Eustace Goddard offered twenty-five thousand dollars’
reward for information which would lead to the recovery
of his son. A second article, brief but placed in significant
juxtaposition to it, declared that no further progress
had been made in the investigation into the death of
the valet, Alfred Hughes, who had succumbed to the effects
of the little-known poison physostigmine soon after
leaving the residence of his employer Mr. Henry Orbit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
in the New Queen’s Mall six days before, but the authorities
expected to make an important arrest in connection
with it in the immediate future.</p>

<p>Inspector Druet’s impatient ring brought McCarty
quickly to his feet and as the former sprang up the stairs
he flung open the living-room door.</p>

<p>“Mac, what the devil have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“Me, inspector?” McCarty’s face was a study, but he
had misunderstood.</p>

<p>“Yes! Why weren’t you on the job? They’ve raised
hell in the Mall last night while I was chasing up some
false clues about the Goddard case and I haven’t laid
eyes on you since the medical examiner’s assistant arrived
at Orbit’s yesterday!”</p>

<p>“I’ve been getting a bit of sleep, this morning,” McCarty
replied evasively. “Did you see Parsons? You
told me he’d been robbed,—did he say what was stole
from him?”</p>

<p>“No. That’s the queer part of it. When he phoned
to headquarters he was anxious to talk but as soon as I
got to his house he began to hedge. A whole pane had
been removed from one of the rear windows, and the
telephone and Kip alarm system wires were cut, but he
couldn’t show me that anything in his study had been
disturbed, and although he insisted that some documents
had been stolen from his filing case he would tell me
nothing about them except that some were notes for a
book he was writing and the rest of a highly personal
nature.”</p>

<p>“If ’twas nothing of money value I’d not be bothering
about it,” McCarty suggested hurriedly. “He got off
light, considering what’s happened at other houses on
that block.—Look at Orbit! Wasn’t he drugged besides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
to say nothing of the murder committed there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but nothing was stolen from him. He tells me he
took a bromide to try to sleep, for the shock of the girl’s
death in the afternoon had about made him go to pieces.
He was just dozing off when he thought he heard something
in the room. He couldn’t be sure and before he
could make a move a towel was clapped over his face;
the next thing he knew he woke up mighty sick. He
would have thought the whole thing was a nightmare,
only there was the towel saturated with chloroform in a
corner of the room, the bottle itself on a stand beside
his bed and the windows open wider than he had left
them. The rest of the household, including Sir Philip
Devereux and his valet, Harry Blake, weren’t even disturbed.
There’s no sign of how the burglar got in, except
that the side door opening from the card-room was
found unbolted this morning, though Ching Lee swears
he fastened it as usual last night, and the telephone wires
outside the house were cut, just as Parsons’ were.”</p>

<p>“Well, if Orbit has recovered and nothing was taken
there’s been small harm done there, either,” McCarty
commented, adding: “Is Sir Philip going to stay on at
Orbit’s?”</p>

<p>“He sails Saturday. I should think he’d find Orbit’s
kind of hospitality a little strenuous, although he seems
to be a fine old sport!—Mac, what are we to do? I’m
about at the end of my rope, and though the happenings
last night don’t mean actual tragedy they show how little
the scoundrels back of these crimes are afraid of being
found out!”</p>

<p>In the clear morning light the inspector’s face seemed
to have aged years and McCarty’s heart smote him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know, sir,” he said. “If just papers that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
were useful to no one but himself were taken from Parsons
and nothing at all from Orbit maybe some one just
pulled off those two stunts to throw you off the track of
the two murders and the kid’s disappearance.—Have you
heard from Martin?”</p>

<p>“He’s back and Blaisdell the artist came with him.
Blaisdell’s at Goddard’s now, offering whatever help he
can give, but he hasn’t seen Horace since the boy came
to his studio to bid him good-by; I talked to him and I’d
swear he’s on the level. It’s the most infernal mystery—!”</p>

<p>“Has the autopsy been performed yet on that girl
Lucette?” McCarty’s tones had lowered.</p>

<p>“Just an hour ago. Mac, it’s got the whole medical
bureau going! The examiner agrees with Dr. Allonby,
but he can’t go any further! The kind of gas that was
used is a new one on them, deadlier than any sort the
war produced and they’ve sent to Washington to find out
if anything is known of it there.—Thanks.” Inspector
Druet accepted the cigar which the other proffered and
after it was alight he added: “Fluorine gas is one of
its component parts—”</p>

<p>“Fluorine!” McCarty paused, with the match halfway
to his own cigar.</p>

<p>“Yes, but there are other properties with it; fluorine
burns, you know, but there was no trace of that on the
girl’s face, although her lungs were seared. How it was
ever forced on her is beyond me, and the Chief is raging
like a caged bear!” He shook his head dejectedly.
“If we don’t show results mighty soon I’m due for a
transfer and that means the beginning of the end; but I
don’t feel that so keenly as I do my sense of failure! I
had a chance for quick action when that valet was poisoned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
but now that little boy and the fine young French
girl—God, it seems as though I had been criminally
negligent!”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, inspector!” McCarty exclaimed earnestly.
“It’s just like I was saying to Denny; we’re up
against the worst case and the cleverest murdering devil
in the history of the department and we’ll not be laying
him by the heels by working along behind him. It’s
from what he’s going to pull in the future that we’ll get
him, and then only through out-guessing him. Who’ll
be the next? That’s the question we’ve got to answer.”</p>

<p>When, after threshing the situation over thoroughly
once more, the inspector finally took his departure, McCarty
put in a long hour studying the papers taken from
Parsons’ filing case. The collection of reports, evidently
transcriptions from court and police records, besides the
names of Jennie Malone, Chris Porter and the boy Danny
Sayre, comprised those of Bert Ferris, Hannah Cray
and Bessie Dillon. Ferris had been convicted of insurance
fraud, but Parsons had annotated the report:
“Great provocation through need for dependents.” Hannah
Cray was a shoplifter and Bessie Dillon a confidence
worker and after the names of both women had been
written: “Reform assured.”</p>

<p>The manuscript proved to be a compilation of scattered
and disconnected notes, relative to various methods
employed in modern warfare, together with lengthy
diatribes against the sin of organized killing. McCarty
had little patience to peruse it. The references to fluorine
gas gave merely the formula and effect.</p>

<p>Without glancing again at the article on Calabar bean,
McCarty put the torn page away with the other papers
but slipped the odd, silvery bookmark in his pocket. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
violent rainstorm was raging and taking a stout umbrella
he clapped on his hat, locked the door behind him
and descended to the street. Here he was pounced upon
by a young man with a shock of very red hair, who had
been lying in wait for him in Monsieur Girard’s shop
doorway.</p>

<p>“Hey, Mac, got you at last! What brought Inspector
Druet to you so early this morning? Anything new
turned up in that merry little three-ring circus of crime
that is giving a continuous performance under your noses
over at the New Queen’s Mall?”</p>

<p>The taunt was a shrewdly calculated one, but McCarty
grinned affably.</p>

<p>“I see your <em>Bulletin</em> this morning has only the story
of the girl’s death yesterday afternoon, Jimmie; that’s
old stuff, now.”</p>

<p>Jimmie Ballard opened his eyes and ducked confidentially
under the shelter of McCarty’s umbrella.</p>

<p>“For the love of Pete, has there been more doing?”
he gasped. “Come across, Mac! You know I’m always
ready to do you a good turn! What’s up now?”</p>

<p>“We-ell,” McCarty assumed an air of troubled indecision.
“Of course there’s no one between those gates
would breathe a word of it to you newspaper guys and
if I was to tell you about the two robberies it might get
back to me. Not being regularly on the Force any more
I’d not want the inspector to think—”</p>

<p>“Two robberies!” Jimmie’s eyes shone. “Pretty!
Mac, let me get the story through to the shop and we’ll
have an ‘extra’ out in half an hour! I’ll keep you out
of it, I swear—!”</p>

<p>“All right, then, if you’ll do something for me after,”
McCarty suddenly reached into his pocket and drew out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
Parsons’ bookmark. “Find out what the devil is this
made of and ’phone me at my rooms to-night; mind you
don’t mention it in your story or never another tip will
you get from me!—Now, here’s what happened....”</p>

<p>He repeated briefly the inspector’s version of the incidents
of the previous night and then, well satisfied, he
continued on his way. It led him on a long and diversified
path through that day’s storm; to headquarters, the
Public Library, the city’s mortuary and the laboratories
of the university. For the first time since the inception
of the strangely complex case he steered clear of the Mall
and it was not until darkness had fallen that he returned
to his rooms, rain-soaked and weary.</p>

<p>Inside the living-room he felt mechanically for the
light switch in the wall, but the button clicked futilely.
At the same moment he lifted his nose in the air and
sniffed sharply.</p>

<p>Some one had been in his rooms again! His lights
had been tampered with, for they were on the same current
as the house next door and a ray from there was
even now streaking faintly across the air-shaft past his
bedroom window. Moreover there’d been nothing wrong
with his switch the night before! Was somebody waiting
for him?</p>

<p>Aware that the feeble gas jet in the hall below was
yet strong enough to silhouette him vaguely in its glimmering
half-light, he pulled the door shut behind him
and whipped out his revolver.</p>

<p>“Is anybody here?” His bull-throated demand cut
the silence. “Come on, you white-livered son-of-a-gun,
and I’ll give you the fight of your life!”</p>

<p>He waited, his ears strained to catch the slightest
sound, but none came; no stir of a foot, no whisper of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
breathing broke the utter stillness in which the echo of
his voice had died away and after a minute that seemed
ages long doubt changed to certainty.</p>

<p>Somebody had been there and gone; but had he gone
far? What had been done in his rooms that he was not
meant to see? What had the intruder left behind him
for McCarty to blunder into in the darkness? Had a
trap been set for him under his own roof?</p>

<p>McCarty pressed his lips grimly together, his square
jaw outthrust. Keeping his revolver still cocked and
ready in his right hand he reached behind him with the
other and propped his umbrella against the wall. Then
half-stooping he advanced a step straight before him in
the direction of the fireplace. With infinite caution and
the delicacy of one in a maze of live wires his left hand
groped about in the pitch blackness surrounding him,
but it encountered only empty air. He took another step
forward, then another....</p>

<p>At last! At the height of about his middle from the
floor his fingers touched a fine cord drawn straight across
his path, so taut that it vibrated like a harp-string beneath
a contact as light as a mere breath! Running his
fingers along it with the light touch of a drifting feather
he moved to the left until the cord made a sharp turn
around the corner of his heavy desk. Once more he
started forward. Now he was facing again toward the
fireplace but the left side of it, and his guiding line was
rising! It must be at the height of the mantel now, he
must almost have reached the shelf itself!</p>

<p>Moving even more cautiously, inch by inch, his fingers
traveling with still greater delicacy, he followed the cord
to the corner of the mantel. There his hand came in
contact with what appeared to be a pulley, rigged ingeniously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
over the clamp of a portable lamp bracket which
had never been fastened there before.</p>

<p>If the cord were broken something on the other end
of that pulley running under the mantel would drop; and
then what would happen? Would the house be blown to
bits in the explosion of some infernal machine, or something
fall on him from above? It had obviously been
intended that he should break that string; but why had
it been taken for granted that finding his lights out of
commission he would walk straight forward from the
doorway, instead of perhaps around the wall—?</p>

<p>His matches, of course! He wouldn’t be supposed to
stop and fumble in his clothes for any he might be carrying
when a whole box of them were where he always
kept them there on the mantel before him! ’Twas from
the mantel itself, then, or just under it, that trouble could
be looked for, if the weight on the other end of that
pulley dropped, and that trouble would occur somewhere
in a line with the doorway!</p>

<p>Shifting his revolver to his left hand McCarty felt
with the right for the weight dangling from the end
of the pulley. His compressed lips widened at the corners
in a grim smile as he followed it up again and
along under the edge of the mantel until his fingers met
the cold ring of a revolver muzzle.</p>

<p>So that was the answer! When the weight dropped,
that cord, as fine and strong as fishline, which he could
feel wound around the trigger, would snap back and from
that muzzle would streak forth a death message, certain
and sure!</p>

<p>But not while McCarty knew it! Dropping his own
revolver into his pocket he swiftly and skilfully disengaged
the cord from about the trigger of the other and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
drew it from the cradle of wire which had been strung
over two nails driven into the underside of the mantel-shelf.
Placing it upon the mantel within easy reach he
found it but the work of a moment to jerk down the
lamp bracket and its improvised pulley, break and haul
in the cord and throw the whole mechanical device into
the empty fireplace.</p>

<p>Then another thought came to him. Suppose the party
who had planned that little surprise for him were waiting
about in the immediate vicinity, near enough to have
seen him come in, close enough at hand to hear the
anticipated report? Wouldn’t he be likely to come then
to see the result for himself? Wouldn’t that be his next
logical move?</p>

<p>His next move! Since he entered the room McCarty
had been too busy to wonder why this reception had been
arranged for him, but now a light broke over his mind
and he all but chuckled aloud. He’d been asking himself
and Denny a question for the last twenty-four hours
and now by the Lord it was answered for him!</p>

<p>But why should his enemy be disappointed? Why
shouldn’t he hear that shot after all, and in coming to
investigate, reveal his own identity? There was nothing
above the ceiling but the loft and nothing above
that again but the roof and the clouds that were pouring
down rain that minute! With a sudden impulse McCarty
seized the revolver from the mantel, aimed it
straight up into the air and fired, then jumped nimbly
aside, crouching behind the great armchair.</p>

<p>The echo of the shot had scarcely died away when
there came a terrific banging upon the entrance door below
and this time a hoarse chuckle did force its way from
McCarty’s throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>That was the game, was it?—To pretend he was just
passing and raise all the hell he could getting in, so as
to attract attention to the fact that he came after the
shot was fired? Let him bang away and break the door
down! The one who’d come up those stairs would be
the one who had rigged up that murder machine!</p>

<p>The banging gave place to a moment of silence and
then came a mighty crash, followed by another and another,
till at length the door fell inward with a snap of
the lock and a rending jar, and some one sobbing harshly,
chokingly, came bounding and scrambling up the stairs,
preceded by a wildly darting flashlight which played under
the living-room door. Then that door also was flung
wide, the light swept about and a broken voice in the
throes of mental agony howled dolorously:</p>

<p>“Mac! For the love of God, what’s happened to you!”</p>

<p>McCarty came out sheepishly from behind the chair.</p>

<p>“I’ve been handling revolvers since first I went on the
cops, Denny, with never a mischance, but when the lights
went out on me just now all of a sudden whilst I was
cleaning this I’ll be damned if it didn’t go off in my
hand!”</p>

<span class="fs80">FOREWARNED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Dennis’</span> lacerated emotions were finally soothed and
after an old oil lamp was resurrected from the
store-closet and lighted he seated himself for a pipe and
a chat, but the shock had disorganized him beyond concentration
on the case and he departed early for the fire
house.</p>

<p>McCarty had carefully kept his bulk between his visitor
and the sight of what lay in the fireplace and the moment
the latter went away he removed the death-dealing paraphernalia
and locked it in his bedroom closet beneath a
pile of old boots, together with the revolver. This had
proved on examination to be a replica of his own old
service one. How could his would-be assassin have come
into possession of a “police positive,” a .38 manufactured
for the department alone?</p>

<p>While he was pondering this the telephone rang and
Jimmie Ballard’s voice came to him over the wire.</p>

<p>“Say, Mac, do you know what that was you handed
me to-day? A silver leaf!”</p>

<p>“It looked kind of like a leaf and there was a silvery
tinge to it Jimmie, but I thought it was made of flat
plush!” McCarty replied. “I’m no wiser than I was before.
What is it?”</p>

<p>“A leaf from an African silver-tree, of a species that
grows most plentifully on Table Mountain, just back of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
Cape Town; no telling how old it is, for they last forever
if they’re not handled too much. Where did you
get it and what has it to do with that little affair you and
I were talking about this morning?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing in the world!” McCarty avowed hastily.
“’Tis just something I picked up. I’ll be thankful if
you’ll put it in an envelope and mail it to me special delivery,
though.”</p>

<p>“All right!” Jimmie laughed. “Of course it isn’t
important when you’ve got to have it by ‘special,’ and you
were willing to trade the best beat of the year for information
about it, but give me the dope on it one jump
ahead of the other boys and I won’t ask any more. Did
you see our extra?”</p>

<p>McCarty cut short the youthful Jimmie’s enthusiasm.
He had to stand with his back squarely to the door to
talk into the ’phone and he didn’t know when his mysterious
visitor might return. That shot had miraculously
not aroused the neighborhood but undoubtedly that was
because of the noise of wind and rain. Would the author
of his little surprise have sufficient strength of mind
to remain away and wait to see if the morning papers
held any account of the possible tragedy?</p>

<p>He would, if he was one and the same with the human
fiend who had brought all those horrors to pass in
the Mall, and of that McCarty was morally convinced.
He had told Dennis and the inspector, too, that it would
be only by out-guessing him and anticipating who his
next victim was scheduled to be that they could hope to
solve the mystery. Now he grinned to himself; little
had he thought then who was elected!</p>

<p>But the event of the evening made one fact manifest;
the man was afraid! He was beginning to show weakness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
his armor was cracking, his nerve was giving way!
The desperate chance he had taken of being discovered
at his work, the very elaborateness of the scheme itself,
told of the effort made in a frenzy of guilty apprehension
to wipe out one of those who represented the law.</p>

<p>Yet the brain which had conceived and carried to a
successful conclusion two such strange crimes as the
murders, to say nothing of the making away with the
child Horace, would be more than a match for the present
situation. Having learned of his first failure he
would be doubly on the alert and wary. McCarty had
drawn his fire and in all probability there would be a
cessation of crimes in the Mall while he gave his attention
to those who threatened to thwart his hideous
activities.</p>

<p>The storm raged even more fiercely, as the hour grew
late, and for more reasons than one McCarty was reluctant
to venture forth for his forgotten dinner. He
unearthed a battered percolator, tinned meat and crackers
and made a light meal, retiring to bed at last with his
revolver beneath the pillow.</p>

<p>When he awakened a dark day had broken and he lay
for a time listening to the wind roaring down the chimney
and the rain driving in sheets against the windows
while he formed an immediate plan. He must work
alone, for Denny would be on duty again for twenty-four
hours straight, and he welcomed the fact. If there were
to be any further attempts made upon him, the faithful
Denny must not share the danger; it would be just
Denny’s luck to walk into a trap not meant for him!</p>

<p>As for himself, McCarty meant to give his adversary
every opportunity to try again. He shaved and dressed,
and as he did so his blood raced as in the old days, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
joy of the contest, yet now for the first time in his
career he was hunted, not hunter; he had, in a twinkling,
changed places with the arch-murderer and child-stealer
and the thought gave added zest to the problem of the
future. He was leaving for his accustomed restaurant
when the telephone shrilled and he paused before taking
down the receiver.</p>

<p>His visitor of the night before could already have
learned from the papers that his attempt had failed, but
what if he were ringing up now to be sure that the event
had not actually occurred and remained as yet undiscovered?
Would he betray himself by surprise at the
sound of his intended victim’s voice?</p>

<p>McCarty unhooked the receiver, waited a moment, and
then called in a sudden, hearty tone:</p>

<p>“Hello!”</p>

<p>“Am I addressing ex-Roundsman McCarty?” The
voice which came to him was elderly and formal, and, as
McCarty replied in the affirmative, he was certain he had
never heard it before.</p>

<p>“Inspector Druet suggested that I telephone and ask
you for an interview on a strictly private matter, Mr.
McCarty. This is Benjamin Parsons speaking, of Number
Seven, New Queen’s Mall.” His tone betrayed not
the slightest emotion. “Can you tell me when you will
be at liberty to come to me?”</p>

<p>“In one hour, Mr. Parsons,” McCarty responded
promptly. “’Tis about what happened night before
last?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” There was a note of finality in the quick, firm
monosyllable. “In an hour, Mr. McCarty.”</p>

<p>The click of a distant receiver came to his ears and
McCarty went out with a puzzled frown. Had the inspector<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
an inkling as to the identity of Parsons’ “burglar”
and was he passing the buck?</p>

<p>Thrust half under his door he found an envelope with
a special delivery stamp; Jimmie Ballard had kept his
word and returned the silver leaf. McCarty slipped it
into his pocket and went out into the downpour, but his
thoughts were almost immediately diverted from it by
the Italian news-vendor on the corner, an acquaintance of
many years’ standing.</p>

<p>“You on da job again!” White teeth gleamed in the
swarthy countenance. “Diss-a pape’ say you gonna fin’ da
guy w’at murd’ da French-a girl!”</p>

<p>It was the <em>Bulletin</em> and Jimmie Ballard’s idea of a
joke was to announce the rumor that former Roundsman
Timothy McCarty, whose achievements in the department
had been unique and notable, had been reattached
to the detective bureau for special investigation in
connection with the crime wave in the New Queen’s Mall
and important developments might be expected shortly.</p>

<p>McCarty passed it by with a grunt. His eye was
caught by a brief paragraph, lower on the page, and he
stood still, unheeding the rain which streamed down his
neck from his tilted umbrella. It was a bald statement
that George Radley, the poisoner who escaped from Sing
Sing a month before, had been found wandering in a
hopelessly demented condition on the upper East Side and
would undoubtedly be committed to Matteawan. The
clothing he wore was being traced, in an effort to locate
the possible accomplices to his escape.</p>

<p>With a nod to the news-vendor McCarty hurried on
at last, and while he awaited his order at the little restaurant
he gave himself up to reflection. Was that why
Parsons had sent for him? Had he learned that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
escaped prisoner received aid from beneath his roof?</p>

<p>He ate hastily and then made all speed to the New
Queen’s Mall, where just within the gate he ran into
Inspector Druet.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard from Parsons?” the latter asked.</p>

<p>McCarty nodded.</p>

<p>“He said you told him to send for me. Whatever for,
sir?” His tone was blandly innocent. “What can I
tell the old gentleman about his lost papers?”</p>

<p>“It’s what he’ll tell you, if you can get it out of him;
I can’t,” confessed his superior. “He’s got something
up his sleeve, all right, and if he weren’t such a well-known
character I’d think he guessed more about that
robbery than he was willing to say! The other one who
was holding out on us came across last night but it isn’t
going to help any except to remove one more possibility.”</p>

<p>“Who was it?” demanded McCarty.</p>

<p>“Eustace Goddard. The only thing that has kept him
and his wife both going during these three days since
the boy disappeared was their own private suspicion that
he had been kidnapped for ransom and would be held
safely until the exchange could be made, but now that
hope has gone. The man they thought had taken Horace
away was a former business associate of Goddard’s, down
and out now. He applied to Goddard for financial help,
it seems, at a time when it would have saved him, and
when it was refused he threatened to make Goddard pay
if he stripped him of the most precious thing he had.
Goddard has been quietly looking for him since the trouble
came and expecting him hourly to make a demand
for a large sum; that was why he was willing to offer
such a huge reward. Last evening, however, he ran him
to earth and found out that the poor devil had been ill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
in a sanitarium for months and didn’t know anything
about Horace. Mrs. Goddard is almost insane—Allonby
is attending her—and Goddard himself is nearly as bad
but I can only put him off with the same old promises
and bunk!—Look over there now; that’s the boy’s police
dog Max. He’s grieving himself to death, they tell me.
Mac, if we don’t do something soon—!”</p>

<p>“We’ll be sitting tight and let the other fellow show
his hand, the guy that’s been pulling all these murders
and such.” They had passed down the block together
toward the Parsons house and as he spoke McCarty
glanced across the street to the court beside the Goddards’.
The slim, smooth-coated police dog was pacing restlessly
up and down with the slinking, mechanical movement
of a beast in captivity, his swaying head hung low
and tail drooping.</p>

<p>The inspector followed his companion’s gaze.</p>

<p>“Trafford says he tried to coax Max to go for a walk
but the dog won’t go further than that from the house;
they’re one-man creatures anyway, that breed, and the
boy was his god.—If you can get anything that looks like
straight dope out of the old gentleman ’phone me at the
medical examiner’s office.”</p>

<p>He went on and McCarty ascended the steps of the
Parsons residence and rang the bell. His summons was
replied to after some little delay by a youth who carried
himself smartly if awkwardly in his page’s uniform. The
bright if somewhat weak face seemed abnormally pale,
however, and his sharp eyes shifted in a scared fashion.</p>

<p>“Name’s McCarty,” the newcomer announced briefly.
“Mr. Parsons expects me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” The youth’s tone was almost servile.
“You can go right back to his study, sir. I’ll show you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>He led the way to the room which McCarty had already
visited surreptitiously two nights before, and
knocked on the door.</p>

<p>“Come in.” The same dignified, elderly voice which
had sounded over the telephone answered the rapping and
a man rose slowly from behind the desk as they entered.
He was tall and powerfully built, with a keen, intellectual
face softened by warm, gray eyes and a well-molded
mouth, sensitive yet firm. His finely shaped head was
covered with a shock of snow-white hair as long as a
mane and his old-fashioned high stock and severely cut
black coat made him resemble a figure from the past.
He looked to McCarty’s eyes as though he might have
stepped out of one of the frames in his own portrait
gallery, but there was no suggestion of a pose about him.
Without sound or gesture he appeared to dominate the
room and his caller felt almost abashed in his presence.</p>

<p>What would the old gentleman think if he knew the
actual burglar stood before him? McCarty could feel
his honest face grow hot, but he held his chin a trifle
higher. After all, Parsons had known about fluorine gas
and powdered Calabar bean, he’d a bunch of crooks in
his house and knew it, and when his notes had been
taken he didn’t feel like coming clean about them! He
might have a bit of explaining to do himself!</p>

<p>“Lieutenant McCarty, sir.” The elevation in rank was
patent flattery and McCarty’s eyes twinkled as Benjamin
Parsons bowed.</p>

<p>“That will do, Danny.—Mr. McCarty,” he added as
the page boy withdrew, “I have asked you to come here
because your inspector is occupied with matters of graver
import to the little community in the Mall. From your
question over the telephone this morning I gather you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
have been informed of the occurrence here on Wednesday
night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Parsons,” McCarty replied. “Your house
was entered by way of the rear window, wasn’t it, and
some papers taken? As I heard it, the wires were cut
outside and a pane of glass knocked out.”</p>

<p>“An interior alarm system of my own was also very
cleverly disconnected so that it would not register in my
bedroom.—But won’t you sit down?” A slender hand
waved to a chair and McCarty obeyed. “All this is as
unimportant as is the identity of the intruder, or as his
identity would be if he had come merely for gain like
the usual housebreaker; but this he was not. Articles of
value were practically within reach of his hand—gold
and silver plate, ivories and bronzes and ceramics which
would have meant a fortune to the ordinary burglar, remained
undisturbed, while the documents he searched for
and found could be of no possible pecuniary benefit to
him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Parsons’ eyes were fastened on McCarty in an
earnest, steady gaze which the latter found somehow disconcerting.
He cleared his throat nervously.</p>

<p>“The inspector told me ’twas notes for a book that was
missing, and some other papers that was personal,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“Personal to others than myself, I regret to say,” Mr.
Parsons shook his head. “That is why I did not go
into particulars at first, but since I reported the matter
to the authorities I have made another discovery which,
taken in connection with the rest, leaves me no choice.
The personal documents removed from this filing case
over here related to the unfortunate past history of several
people whom I count among my friends and it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
be unjust to give publicity to them now, much less to
permit these records to remain in unworthy hands. The
manuscript of my book is perhaps small loss to the world,
but it is the result of years of profound thought and research.
I may add that it was intended as a message,
an appeal for universal peace and I had dwelt in detail
upon the horrors of the last war, describing in full the
methods employed by man to destroy his fellows. I am
stating this because one of the weapons so described was
fluorine gas, and the formula was given. Fluorine gas
has been mentioned in the papers in connection with the
sad death of the young nurse across the street, but I did
not even think of the coincidence until I made a further
discovery last night.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” McCarty felt that the question was
expected of him although he well knew what was coming.
Was the old gentleman the grand character he appeared
or as shrewd as they make them and playing safe?
He could have blushed for his own suspicious mind, but
Parsons called the crooks his “friends” and was trying
to protect them. What the devil did it all mean?</p>

<p>“When your inspector first called upon me to make
certain inquiries last week, at the time a manservant—from
the same house as that in which the young girl
passed away—also died, he told me of the poison believed
to have been used: physostigmine.”</p>

<p>“Calabar bean,” McCarty nodded.</p>

<p>“Quite so. I had never heard of it, as it happened,
and I looked it up in some books of reference I have;
books in common use in every home of intelligent interests.
I was called away before I had finished reading
the article and marked the page. That page, Mr. McCarty,
has been torn from my encyclopædia, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
could only have been done on Wednesday evening.”</p>

<p>The gentle yet dominating voice had continued in its
level, perfectly controlled monotone and McCarty looked
down at the floor but felt impelled to raise his eyes again.
If only the old gentleman would look away for a minute!</p>

<p>“It seems like a queer sort of burglar that would tear
a page out of a book he could find anywhere, and the
fact that it was an article about Calabar bean, and the
notes on fluorine gas gone too—!” The words stuck in
McCarty’s throat but he forced himself to go on: “Why
should he have took them just from here, when the damage
was done with the both of them, and how did he
know where to get them, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I have been asking myself those questions but I cannot
answer them. However, I am convinced that those
two coincidences are more than coincidences and it was
my duty to report them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course.” McCarty shuffled one foot. “Mr.
Parsons, what’s become of your butler, Chris Porter?—Roberts,
he called himself here.”</p>

<p>He had launched the question with deliberate abruptness
but the gray eyes did not waver.</p>

<p>“You knew of his identity? The record of his misfortune
was one of those taken from my filing case.”</p>

<p>“I recognized him and he made a certain confession
to me the other day.” McCarty returned the gaze with
interest now and he saw Mr. Parsons start slightly, a
faint flush rising in the smooth pallor of his cheeks.</p>

<p>“A confession? Christopher was a broken man, subjected
to a persecution which would have been unfair
even if he were guilty of the charge for which he had
suffered imprisonment but I am convinced of his absolute
innocence!” he asserted vigorously. “A grave miscarriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
of justice had been committed; I could not restore
to him the years which our penal system had taken from
him but I was endeavoring to help him get on his mental
and moral feet again, to win back his self-respect! Mr.
McCarty, if Christopher made any supposed confession it
must have been wrung from him by coercion! Innocent
or guilty he has paid the penalty the State demanded!”</p>

<p>“Sure, for complicity in that poisoning case, if that’s
what you mean, but ’twas not that he confessed. Mr.
Parsons, I’d like to ask you something.” McCarty bent
forward. “If a guy—I mean a man—was sent up and
escaped and you thought he was innocent, would you
think it your duty to hide him or turn him over to the
law again?”</p>

<p>“I should deliver him to the authorities.” The answer
came without an instant’s hesitation. “A man’s
personal opinion could not be allowed to weigh against
the mandates of our laws or our whole social fabric
would centuries ago have been undermined. The individual
must be submerged in the collective body, if civilization
is to endure!—But why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“You knew that Radley, the fellow sentenced with
Porter, escaped a month ago and that he was caught last
night?”</p>

<p>“I knew that he had escaped but not that he was recaptured!”
Mr. Parsons spoke in oddly shocked accents.
“The newspapers doubtless have an account of it, but I
was too disturbed in mind this morning to glance at
them.—Where was the unfortunate man found?”</p>

<p>“Not where he was last Sunday, Mr. Parsons!” McCarty
retorted significantly. “He’s supposed to be crazy
now, so he’ll go to the asylum instead of back up the
river, but he wasn’t crazy last Sunday, nor the week<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
and more before that, when he laid hid in the empty
house next door here, fed from your table and cared for
by some one in your house! That was Porter’s confession,
and I’m asking you where is he?”</p>

<p>“He has gone!” Parsons rested his elbow on his desk
and shielded his eyes with his hand. “I never suspected
this! Christopher laid the table for breakfast as usual
this morning and arranged the mail and the newspapers;
it must have been then that he saw the account of Radley’s
capture and ran away, panic-stricken for fear that he
might fall into the hands of the law again! I have
thought that he seemed more deeply troubled this week;
if he had only come to me, and let me convince him of
his higher duty! I have failed with him, failed!”</p>

<p>Deep distress throbbed with a note of pain in his tone
but McCarty persisted dryly:</p>

<p>“That’s as may be, sir. He left about the time the
papers came? That’ll be around eight o’clock? Was it
before or after you ’phoned to me that you knew of it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Parsons’ hand fell.</p>

<p>“Just before. I knew no reason for his departure and
he left no word, but the condition of his room showed
hurried flight. It was then that I decided to place myself
unreservedly in your hands.”</p>

<p>“Because of that missing dope about fluorine gas and
Calabar bean, and his own past history?” McCarty demanded.
“Because he’d already been convicted of
poison—!”</p>

<p>“Stop!” Mr. Parsons rose. “Christopher was innocent
of that old charge and he was equally innocent of
the crimes which have been committed this past week!
He was mistaken in his sense of duty, but not a murderer!”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">McCarty</span> left the Parsons house a few minutes
later, his mind a chaos of conflicting impressions.
With the sonorous, dignified tones still ringing upon his
ear and the deeply concerned gaze yet seemingly bent
upon him Benjamin Parsons appeared the epitome of
rectitude and righteousness, but had he been as certain
of Porter’s innocence as he claimed, and was he as ignorant
of where he had gone?</p>

<p>He crossed the street to Orbit’s house and glanced
again into the court between that and Goddard’s. Max
was still there, but he had lain down as though exhausted
and his ribs, glistening with the rain, showed pitifully
gaunt. Why didn’t they take the poor fellow in? McCarty
stopped and spoke coaxingly to him. The dog
slowly rolled his lack-luster eyes upon him but made no
other response.</p>

<p>For a long minute McCarty stood thoughtfully regarding
the dog. When, at last, he continued on his
way there was a curiously absent look upon his face.</p>

<p>Ching Lee admitted him and took him to the library
where he had first been received. A small fire of some
strange, peat-like fuel was burning on the hearth, sending
out iridescent flames and a faint pervasive odor as
of sandalwood, and before it Orbit was seated, with a
stout, florid man in tweeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“Good-morning, McCarty. I rather thought that you
or the inspector would look in on me this morning.”
Orbit turned to his guest. “Sir Philip, this is Deputy
McCarty, the official who is working with Inspector
Druet on the investigation into this hideous mystery.”</p>

<p>Sir Philip Devereux nodded to the ex-roundsman cordially.</p>

<p>“Shocking affair, this! Shocking!” he commented.
“Here for a little private chat with Mr. Orbit, what?
I’ll leave you—”</p>

<p>“No, don’t go, Sir Philip!” Orbit demurred smilingly.
“You know all the circumstances and McCarty and I
haven’t anything private to discuss. I hope he’s brought
me some news!—You heard about what happened to me
the other night?”</p>

<p>“I did that,” McCarty nodded. “What do you think
’twas done for, if nothing was taken?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t the remotest idea.—Sit down here by the
fire, man, you’re soaked through!” Orbit added hospitably.
“I’ll have Ching Lee bring you a touch of
something from my private stock—?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mr. Orbit; I’ve a twinge of the gout
now and then, though you mightn’t think it,” McCarty
explained speciously. “I just dropped by to see if you’d
thought of anything to add to what you told the inspector
about the chloroforming?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. The whole thing happened so quickly and
the impressions left on my mind were so vague, that I
am afraid I can be of little use to you. One thing seems
certain; the fellow didn’t intend me to die from the
effect of it, since he stopped to open the windows and
throw away the cloth he had used to anæsthetize me!”
Orbit shrugged. “The incident is absolutely inexplicable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
except on the supposition that his only intention was to
terrorize me, and that is really too absurd to consider.”</p>

<p>“It was an outrage!” declared Sir Philip suddenly.
“Damme, it passes belief! The chap must be a fiend—or
mad! What object could he have in doing Hughes
in? I say, there was a valet for you!—Then the girl,
too! That poison gas theory seems to be rot to me, too
utterly impossible with you there in the room, but the
girl is dead, isn’t she? There you are!”</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair and puffed thoughtfully
at his cigar. His host turned to McCarty with a faint
hint of amusement in his eyes but it was quickly overshadowed
by sadness again.</p>

<p>“The girl is dead, poor creature, and I cannot help
feeling that the blame in some way rests at my door,
for I invited her in. However her death was brought
about the child escaped, though; we have that to be
thankful for! We are none of us safe here on the Mall
while the murderer is free to come and go in our houses
at will, killing with impunity whenever the horrible impulse
comes to him! I was reluctant to offer my hospitality
to Sir Philip under these harrowing circumstances
but he expressed himself as willing to abide by the consequences.”</p>

<p>“Ripping experience!” the baronet nodded again.
“Sorry I’m sailing to-morrow! Like nothing better than
to stop and see it through!—Old chap over the way was
robbed the same night, I hear; any clues left there,
McCarty?”</p>

<p>There was no hint of sarcasm in his tone but McCarty
flushed darkly, then he darted a quick glance at the
questioner and a slow smile dawned. The Britisher was
trying to get his goat!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir, the same as here,” he replied. “Mr. Orbit,
you’ve that chloroform bottle? The inspector says ’twas
found on a stand beside your bed.”</p>

<p>“Ching Lee has it, I believe; would you like to see
it?” He rang the bell without waiting for a reply.
“The cloth used was a towel from my own bathroom;
it’s evident that the fellow was familiar with the house
and knew his way about; but how he got in that side
door leading from the card-room, if Ching Lee really
bolted it as usual the night before—? Oh, Ching Lee?”</p>

<p>The butler had appeared silently in the doorway and
now Orbit addressed him in a rapid patter of Chinese.
Ching Lee, as impassive and wooden of countenance
now as before the tragedy, bowed and departed, and
McCarty turned once more to Orbit.</p>

<p>“What time was it, as near as you can figure, that
you were doped?”</p>

<p>“I should say, around two o’clock in the morning,
perhaps a trifle before. Sir Philip and I sat up till after
midnight playing chess, and when I retired I tried for
more than an hour to sleep before I took a bromide.
Things grew hazy after that and I don’t know how
long I dozed before I was conscious of some one in
the room.”</p>

<p>“You got no whiff of anything else before the chloroform
hit you?” McCarty asked. “No smell of a pipe
or cigar if the guy was a smoker, maybe?”</p>

<p>“I smoke so constantly myself that I would scarcely
have noticed it even if there had been time and I were
fully awake.” Orbit raised his brows. “You smoke
yourself, McCarty; could you have detected it?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” McCarty stated the fact modestly. “I’ve not
the nose Denny has, but ’tis easy to tell the smell of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
cigar from a pipe, even if it’s only hanging about the
clothes of a person; a rich, full-flavored cigar with a
body to it leaves a scent that a man will travel with,
whether he gets it himself or not.”</p>

<p>“‘Denny?’” Orbit repeated. “Oh, you mean your
associate, Riordan? Yes, I remember he detected the
odor of that small blaze here a week ago, when the
monkey upset the cigar lighter in my room. Odd
faculty, that, eh, Sir Philip?”</p>

<p>“Jolly, I fancy. I only wish I had it!” Sir Philip
chuckled. “My man makes away with my cigars at a
shockin’ rate but I never can catch him at it. I say,
no one’s disturbed our board, have they?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, no,” Orbit replied. “I gave strict orders and
we can finish the set to-night.—Sir Philip held the amateur
chess championship for Great Britain for five
years.”</p>

<p>He added this to McCarty and then turned as Ching
Lee appeared again and spoke to him once more in his
native tongue. The butler advanced and placed in McCarty’s
hands the bottle he had seen in Orbit’s room
two nights before.</p>

<p>“Has it been uncorked, do you know, since ’twas
found beside you?” McCarty regarded the contents critically,
removed the cork himself for a cautious whiff.
Hurriedly replacing it, he handed the bottle back to
Ching Lee and rose.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” Orbit whipped out his handkerchief
and pressed it to his nose. “I am susceptible to <em>that</em>
odor, at any rate, since Wednesday night!—Sorry not
to be of any greater help to you. I shall depend on
you and the inspector to keep me informed of any developments
that may arise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>As McCarty trudged through the driving rain toward
the east gate once more, he shook his head. Come night,
it would be a week since Hughes had been done to
death, and the end was not yet clear!</p>

<p>He made his way to the lunchroom on Third Avenue
which he and Dennis had previously visited and in deference
to the day ordered fried oysters. They were long
in coming and he rested his elbows wearily on the table.
Was he getting too old for the game, after all? In days
gone by, when he was in harness, he’d have got to the
truth long since. It had been a dog’s life in more ways
than one, yet he regretted more than ever that he had
left it and grown rusty....</p>

<p>All at once he straightened in his chair and sat staring
at the cynical warning to “watch your hat and coat”
on the wall before him as if the legend were wholly unfamiliar
to him. The belated appearance of the waitress
with the oysters roused him from his stupor and he
rose hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Don’t want ’em!” he muttered thickly. “Gimme the
check; I got to beat it!”</p>

<p>Spilling a dime onto the table he took the slip of pasteboard,
paid for his untouched food at the cashier’s desk
and went out as one in a dream. Once around the corner
he seemed galvanized into life and set off briskly
enough for the subway.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later he presented himself at headquarters
and after being closeted with the chief of the
detective bureau for some little time he departed, armed
with certain credentials for the main office of the telephone
company.</p>

<p>There he spent a long and seemingly unproductive
hour going over the calls from the Gotham exchange,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
which included the New Queen’s Mall, for the previous
Tuesday.</p>

<p>Over Goddard’s private wire had gone numerous messages
before Trafford had called Blaisdell’s studio; and
in the late afternoon, when Horace’s continued absence
had caused alarm, there were fully a score of numbers
registered before Goddard himself had summoned
McCarty.</p>

<p>Orbit’s telephone, too, had been busy, with the caterer,
decorator, florist and a musical agency, in connection
with the function of the afternoon. Three messages to
the coal dealer and innumerable others followed, presumably
sent by guests until the evening was far advanced.</p>

<p>Only four calls had been sent from the Bellamy house
and they appeared to have been made by the lady herself,
for they were to modiste, hairdresser, perfumer
and a prominent department store.</p>

<p>Parsons’ telephone had been connected with a foreign
consulate, several charitable societies and a banking
house, while the Sloane household had communicated
with Doctor Allonby, a drug store, an agency for male
nurses, the office number of a noted financier, and several
residence numbers of equally well-known persons.</p>

<p>McCarty copied one or two numbers from each list
and sallied forth to verify them, but, although the afternoon
was long, twilight had not yet come when he returned
to his rooms and entered cautiously.</p>

<p>They had not been intruded upon on this occasion, but
he remained only long enough to secure the page torn
from the encyclopædia and then slipped out again through
the teeming rain to the fire house which domiciled engine
company 023.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>Dennis was matching nickels with Mike in the dormitory
and reaping a rich harvest, but he hastily promised
the loser his revenge later and slid down the pole to
join McCarty.</p>

<p>“I’ve looked for you all afternoon!” he declared reproachfully,
adding: “You’ve news! I can see it in
the eye of you and I might have known something
would start whilst I was out of it!”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing new,” McCarty responded quietly.
“I’ve a queer notion in my head, but it’s too sickening
to spring even after all we know has happened, till I get
hold of something to back it up. Parsons ’phoned for
me this morning—the old gentleman himself—and told
me the truth about what was missing since Wednesday
night, which was no news. He said it was clever, the
way you’d disconnected the inside alarm arrangement—”</p>

<p>“Me!” Dennis’ leathery countenance blanched. “’Tis
what I get for letting you lead me into breaking the law!
Now I’ll get thrown out of the department and pinched,
and Molly will change the baby’s name—!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Parsons did not know ’twas you, Denny, he just
said it had been cleverly done,” McCarty hastened to explain.
“I sprung it on him about Porter and Radley and
asked him what would he do if a fellow escaped that he
thought was innocent and came to him and he spoke up
quick that he’d turn him over to the authorities anyway;
’twould be his higher duty to our social fabric, whatever
that is.”</p>

<p>“It would, would it!” Dennis ejaculated in fine scorn.
“The social fabric could go to blazes for all of me, but
I’d stick to a pal, innocent or no! Howsomever, I’ve
not the grand, cold-blooded principles of him!—You
know the poor devil’s been caught, crazier than a loon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>McCarty nodded.</p>

<p>“Porter knows it, too; he’s beaten it for fear he’ll be
sent up for hiding him.” He finished his account of the
morning’s interview and then drew the torn page from
his pocket. “There’s more to this thing about the
Calabar bean that I didn’t read you, Denny, so I brought
it around and maybe ’twill give us an idea.—Listen:
‘Calabar Bean. Ordeal Nut. The seed of Physostigma
ven-en-osum, a twining, half shrubby plant, native of
Africa.’”</p>

<p>“What of it?” Dennis was frankly bored. “How is
that going to help?”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit.—‘The kernel is hard and white, and yields
its virtue to alcohol and less perfectly to water.—’”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it does, or they’d never have got it down
Hughes, if what we’ve heard of his habits is straight!”
interrupted Dennis, his interest once more aroused.
“There you’ve got it, Mac! Find the last one he took a
drink with and you’ll have the guy that croaked him!”</p>

<p>“That’s not all,” McCarty began again. “‘The beans
are reddish, gray, or’—um—‘Kidney-shaped, and about
the size’—never mind that!—‘Care should be taken to
avoid spontaneous—’”</p>

<p>“Did you trail around here in all the rain to give me
a botany lesson?” Dennis demanded indignantly. “’Tis
not from any book you’ll be learning the truth! I was
that upset last night, what with the revolver shot and
all, that I never thought to ask you, but what did the
old guy you know uptown say about that bu’sted blue
balloon? Could he make out from the way it was rotting
before our eyes the kind of gas there was in it?”</p>

<p>McCarty hesitated and then said slowly:</p>

<p>“Denny, you’ll mind the other night after we had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
examined it I put it in a cracker box while we went for
a bite to eat and when we came home you saw me hunting
around for something?”</p>

<p>“You were trying to whistle, too!” Dennis nodded.
“That always means you think you’re putting something
over! What was it?”</p>

<p>“I was hunting for that cracker box. I knew the
minute we came back into the room somebody’d been
there, for there was the stale smell of a heavy cigar on
the air, not as if he’d been smoking right then, but the
scent of it was strong on him as he passed through the
place; when I found the box missing I knew what he’d
come for.”</p>

<p>“Think of that now! Do you know what it means,
Mac? The murderer knew you and not the medical
examiner’s assistant had taken it from the conservatory!
I wonder if he followed us from then on? The sight
of us parading through the streets with all them balloons
would have told him we were on, if he wasn’t blind!”
Dennis grinned. “Leave the medical examiner find out
what kind of gas was it; we know how ’twas give to her,
though not what busted the balloon right in her face nor
how the gas got in it! The notion come to me that
’twas not meant to kill Lucette, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Not kill her!” exclaimed McCarty. “The first whiff
of it must have knocked her cold!”</p>

<p>“But what if it was intended for the baby and not for
her?” Dennis lowered his voice. “What if the murderer
has a craze for killing children? I’ve heard tell of such
things and so have you! Suppose Hughes was poisoned
by mistake in the first place for Ching Lee, so that little
Fu Moy wouldn’t be protected. Then Horace was taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
away and maybe killed and the Bellamy baby was next on
the list—!”</p>

<p>“Denny, you’re running wild!” McCarty interrupted in
his turn. “The murderer’s brain has got a twist to it,
but he’s not as crazy as all that. Baby-killers are just
stupid, low brutes without the shrewdness or knowledge
to plan such crimes as we’re up against now. We’re
fighting a mind, not a fist with a knife or a club in it!”</p>

<p>“So you’ve been saying!” Dennis retorted disgustedly.
“That comes of those books you’ve been reading! Whilst
you’ve been figuring out his ancestors and the blood that’s
in him to decide is he in the ‘Born’ or ‘Habit’ class,
like that Diagnostic book of yours has it, he’s been having
an Old Home Week in the Mall, kidnapping and killing
right and left! ’Twill be a week to-night—!”</p>

<p>McCarty beat a hasty retreat and took his solitary way
to the restaurant, where he ate a hearty dinner to make
up for the deferred lunch. Then he returned to the
Mall, to prowl about like an unquiet if somewhat too
material ghost. The rain had stopped at last and although
the sky was still partially overcast the glimmer
of a few stars gave promise of a clear dawn. Lights
were brilliant in the Sloane, Parsons and Orbit residences,
but low in Goddard’s and Mrs. Bellamy’s, where the
lady had been in a hysterical state since the murder of
her baby’s nurse.</p>

<p>Yost had been relieved from his post at the mortuary
to take the place of the night watchman, and McCarty
walked up and down with him for more than an hour,
discussing the strange chain of tragedies. All at once,
as they passed the court next to the Goddard house, he
heard a low, coaxing masculine voice and came upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
Trafford bending over something which lay in the
shadows.</p>

<p>“Come on, old fellow!” the tutor was saying. “Come
along in the house like a good boy! Horace isn’t here,
Max, it’s no good waiting—!”</p>

<p>“’Tis a strange acting dog and no mistake, Trafford,”
McCarty remarked.</p>

<p>The tutor looked up.</p>

<p>“He’s grieving himself to death,” he said. “He hasn’t
touched a morsel of food since Tuesday, though we’ve
tempted him with everything, and he is so weak he can
scarcely stand, but he waits about out here all the time
for Horace to come home. I’ve got to get him in now
if I have to carry him!”</p>

<p>At this juncture, however, Max rose languidly to his
feet and began sniffing at McCarty’s boots, whining
softly.</p>

<p>“’Tis like he was trying to talk!” the latter exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I wish he could, if he knows anything!” Trafford replied
sadly. “If Horace isn’t found soon his mother will
lose her mind! McCarty, can’t you people do anything?
Even to know the—the worst would be better than this
horrible uncertainty and suspense!”</p>

<p>“The lad’s disappearance is not the half of what we’re
up against, Trafford,” McCarty reminded him. “We’re
doing everything mortal to find him and soon, maybe
to-morrow, we’re going to take a big chance.”</p>

<p>He watched while the tutor led the dog into the house
and then shaking his head he proceeded to Orbit’s and
rang the bell. It was little Fu Moy, resplendent in his
embroidered serving jacket, who opened the door and
without announcing him, beckoned and preceded him to
the library, where the last interview had taken place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>The room was in deep shadow save for the glow from
the hearth and a single broad beam from a bridge lamp
which played down upon a chessboard laid out on a
small table. At opposite sides of it two silent, intent
figures sat as immovably as graven images. If they were
aware of McCarty’s appearance they made no sign.</p>

<p>Were they hypnotized, or something? The two of
them couldn’t be asleep, sitting bolt upright like that!
McCarty waited a good five minutes and then advanced
slowly into the room but still they appeared oblivious.</p>

<p>Orbit was sitting forward, his eyes glued on the board,
his hands clasped and elbows resting on the arms of the
chair but the florid-faced Englishman appeared to be gazing
off into space with the intent yet absent look of one
absorbed in profound concentration.</p>

<p>Then slowly Orbit’s right hand disengaged itself
from the other and he moved a figure upon the board,
his hand almost mechanically seeking its former position.</p>

<p>A little smile twitched at the corners of Sir Philip’s
mouth and with a swift intake of his breath he moved,
sweeping from the board the figure of shining white with
which Orbit had just played. The latter instantly lifted
his head and raised his eyes to the high, beamed ceiling.
With the slight gesture the first sound broke the stillness,
as a muffled, barely audible exclamation came from Sir
Philip’s throat.</p>

<p>Orbit made one more move and then glanced in amused
commiseration at his friend.</p>

<p>“Checkmate, Sir Philip! I shall give you your revenge
in London next season!”</p>

<p>“I say! That was damned clever! Led me right into
ambush, what? I wish some of the masters could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
seen it!—Oh, there you are, McCarty! Are you a chess
player, by any chance?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.” McCarty advanced a step farther. “Mr.
Orbit, Fu Moy showed me straight in and I waited so as
not to disturb you.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right!” Orbit nodded pleasantly. “Our
game is over.—You have news for me?”</p>

<p>“Of a sort. You recall saying on Wednesday that
you thanked heaven the Bellamy baby was old enough to
talk?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” Orbit responded eagerly. “I have tried several
times to see Mrs. Bellamy and little Maude, but the
mother is still almost overcome by the narrow escape of
her child and will not permit her out of her sight for a
moment, while she herself is too prostrated to see any
one.”</p>

<p>“The little one talked to me the other day,” McCarty
vouchsafed.</p>

<p>“She did? Why didn’t you tell me?” Orbit pushed
back his chair and rose. “Did she see any one, hear anything?
Tell me, for God’s sake! This may be most important!”</p>

<p>His fine eyes had lighted and the latent excitement
seemed to have communicated itself to his guest for Sir
Philip also rose.</p>

<p>“No, sir. She knew no more than you or I, but
she kept asking for her balloon. It seems Lucette had
bought it for her off a wop by the gate just before you
invited them in; ’twas a blue one, the baby said, and she
was persistent about it, but I recall seeing no toy balloon
in that conservatory.—Did you?”</p>

<p>“No.” Orbit shook his head. “I really don’t know,
though; I didn’t notice particularly. Surely it couldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
have had anything to do with the case, though!—What is
it, Fu Moy?”</p>

<p>The little coffee boy spoke rapidly in Chinese and after
a moment Orbit turned with a gesture which included
Sir Philip and McCarty.</p>

<p>“I am wanted on the telephone. You will excuse me?”</p>

<p>When he had left the room the Englishman glanced
again at the chessboard with the self-centered absorption
of the enthusiast.</p>

<p>“Too bad you didn’t understand that play! Dash it
all! Very clever! On the twenty-first move, his Knight
captured my pawn. Check. I moved the King to the
Queen’s square. By Jove, he moved the Queen to Bishop’s
sixth. Check. I captured his Queen with my Knight
and then Orbit moved his Bishop to King’s seventh.
Checkmate! Devilish trick, I should say. Really, McCarty,
he had served me with what is known in chess
parlance as ‘The Immortal Partie!’”</p>

<p>“‘Checkmate,’” repeated McCarty slowly. “That
means calling the turn, then, blocking every play; not
winning anything yourself but keeping the other fellow
from moving! ’Tis a poor sort of victory, to my mind,
but better than getting wiped off the board, and the secret
of it is—looking ahead!”</p>

<span class="fs80">DENNIS SUPPLIES A SIMILE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">On</span> Saturday morning, as McCarty opened his door
to proceed to breakfast he caromed violently with
Dennis at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder you wouldn’t look where you’re going!”
the latter observed. “I’ve come straight off duty
without a bite or a shave to find out what’s new, but not
to be thrown downstairs!”</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s eat, then,” invited McCarty. “You can
get a shave after and join me back here, for I’ve had a
’phone from the inspector and he’ll be around soon; he’s
got something to tell us.”</p>

<p>Their meal concluded, Dennis betook himself to his
favorite barber and McCarty returned to his rooms with
the usual collection of newspapers under his arm. Before
the half-open door of the antique shop he paused.
From an inner room at the rear came the deep strains
of a ’cello in a simple, oddly insistent little tune, unsuited
to the strains of a stringed instrument, until they swelled
into a sweeping arpeggio accompaniment. Girard must
have finished setting his stock in order, to be idling away
the early morning hour with his everlasting fiddle!</p>

<p>Nevertheless McCarty listened for a moment longer
and then, pushing open the door, he went in. The ’cello
was silenced and the little old Frenchman’s withered face
peered out inquiringly from between the curtains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, it is you, my friend!” He came forward in welcome.
“You have heard the ’cello? She is in a bad humor
because I play upon her German music once more, but
it is of a quaintness and charm, that witch’s song from
‘Hansel und Gretel’; I go every year to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Is that what you were playing?” McCarty asked politely.
“Would it be opera, now? I’m not up in them, at
all.”</p>

<p>“It is from a fairy story for the children,” Monsieur
Girard explained. “The witch builds a castle of gingerbread
in the woods to attract the little ones and when
they touch it they are destroyed.—But tell me! You are
again of the police, is it not so? You have found the
murderer of my countrywoman?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, Girard. I just stopped by to pass the time of
day, and ask you if you should see that red-headed limb
of Satan, Jimmie Ballard, hanging around, tell him I’ve
left town; he’s too free with his pen entirely!” McCarty
returned with some heat. Then his manner changed.
“You didn’t happen to notice a man who came to see me
night before last, just around dark? I missed him by
only a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“But no, my friend.” Girard shook his head. “It rains
with such fury that one cannot see before the door and I
close the shop while yet it is light.—You do not come in
a long time to spend an evening with the old man!”</p>

<p>His tone was wistful and McCarty responded heartily:</p>

<p>“Sure I’ll come, just as soon as this case is over! Don’t
forget about Jimmie!”</p>

<p>Leaving the shop he mounted the stairs to his apartment
above, and settled himself to read the papers; but
they held little of interest, and, as the inspector still delayed
in coming, he got out his books once more and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
deeply engrossed when Dennis reappeared, freshly shaven
and well-brushed, with a new collar an inch too small
embracing his gaunt neck.</p>

<p>“What are you dolled up for?” his host demanded.
“That collar’s so tight the eyes are bulging out of your
head!”</p>

<p>“Leave be!” retorted Dennis with dignity. “A man
has a right to spruce up of a Saturday! So you’re at
them books again! Where’s the inspector?”</p>

<p>“That’s his ring now.” McCarty rose. “Denny, mind
you listen to what I tell him about Parsons, but don’t add
anything to it. What he don’t know will save a waste
of time.”</p>

<p>“What are you—?” Dennis began, but there was no opportunity
for him to finish his query; the inspector had
taken the stairs two steps at a time and entered without
ceremony.</p>

<p>“Sorry I’m late, Mac.—Hello, Riordan, on the job with
us again? The medical examiner has had news from
Washington.”</p>

<p>“Washington?—Sit down, sir!—About that poison gas,
you mean?” McCarty pushed forward the big armchair.
“Did they find out what it’s made of?”</p>

<p>“As much as will ever be known.” The inspector’s face
was very grave. “I don’t know whether you recall reading
about it or not after all this time, but during the last
months of the war a report went out from the Capital that
a new poison gas had been invented, deadlier than anything
yet tried. The formula was a secret one, the property
of the government. The papers were full of it and
preparations were being made to supply our troops with
it when the armistice came. Nobody except the officials
in charge of that department have thought much about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
it since until our inquiries of the last day or two. Last
night Hinton Sherard, the man responsible for the safety
of that folio of secret documents, blew his brains out;
the formula for the poison gas had disappeared.”</p>

<p>“And ’tis that the murderer used?” Dennis stared.
“Did he steal it from the department?”</p>

<p>“Theft would have been impossible, except for some
one on the inside but the despatches in code from Washington
indicate that Sherard has been deeply involved in
some foreign financial scandal. He managed to extricate
himself about two months ago by the payment of a large
sum; the affair only reached the ears of the departmental
heads when he killed himself publicly in the main dining-room
of the Weyland Hotel and as he never had as much
money as he is reputed to have paid out there’s only one
construction to be put on it. He must have sold the
formula for that gas.”</p>

<p>“It must have taken a mint of money to buy it,” McCarty
observed thoughtfully. “Any of them that live on
the Mall could have afforded it, I suppose, providing they
wanted it bad enough but—two months ago! The murderer
sure planned a good ways ahead! Are you certain
there’s no mistake about it? If nobody knows the
formula—?”</p>

<p>“The chemist who invented it is still living and three
other men in official Washington are familiar with its
component parts. They all agree that the effect of the gas
inhaled by Lucette, as shown by the autopsy, was identical
with what would have been produced by the action of this
unnamed gas, and nothing else known to chemistry would
have had just that result.—Try one of these instead, Mac;
old Mr. Parsons gave them to me and though he doesn’t
smoke himself they ought to be good.” He had drawn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
a handful of fragrant cigars from his pocket as McCarty
proffered the box from the mantel. “The important thing
to us about this affair is that Washington is all excited and
determined to get our man and the formula before it
passes out of his hands, perhaps into those of some foreign
power, do you see?”</p>

<p>“In case there’s another war?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. They’re sending on some picked men from
the Secret Service to investigate and you know what that
will mean; the case will be practically taken out of our
hands.”</p>

<p>“To the everlasting shame of the Force, and through
us!” McCarty sprang to his feet and paced rapidly back
and forth. “It’s hell, ain’t it, inspector? We’ve done all
that mortal could and been blocked at every turn, like Sir
Philip in the chess game with Orbit last night; ’twould be
the devil and all if we fall down on it now!”</p>

<p>“You’ll not!” Dennis sat up suddenly, the ashes from
his pipe falling upon the book laid open across his knee.
“Don’t mind him, sir! He’s got something up his sleeve,
he as good as told me so yesterday afternoon!”</p>

<p>“Denny!” McCarty paused, grimacing horribly at the
base informer. “Don’t you listen to him, inspector! I
had just a notion with nothing to back it up, and if I
sprung it now and it turned out to be wide of the mark
there’s no corner of this earth could hide us from what
would come!”</p>

<p>“What is it?” the inspector demanded. “For God’s
sake, Mac, don’t hold out anything now! It’s more than
your record or my career that is at stake; the pride of the
whole department is in our hands! What is this notion,
as you call it?”</p>

<p>McCarty shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>“It’s no use, sir! If I had one hint of even circumstantial
evidence to support it, I wouldn’t be loafing here this
minute, but I’ll tell you what I will do. Come noon, I’m
thinking I’ll know whether there’s anything in it or no and
if there is I’ll be ’phoning to headquarters, with a request
that’ll maybe surprise you. Whatever it is you’ll let me
have it, for well you know I’d make no move unless I
was sure.”</p>

<p>There was an unmistakable note of finality in his tone
and Inspector Druet acknowledged it with a shrug. In his
troubled eyes a renewed glow of hope had come.</p>

<p>“By noon?” he repeated. “I’ll be there waiting for
your message, Mac.”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile,” McCarty carefully avoided Dennis’
gaze, “I’ve a bit of news for you, sir. Denny and
me have managed to lay our hands on the papers that
have been missing from Parsons’ house.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would!” The shadow of a smile
passed across the inspector’s face. “The department
doesn’t countenance burglary, of course, but when two
such deputies as you take matters into your own hands I
wash mine of the responsibility. What did you find
out?”</p>

<p>Dennis was endeavoring to hide behind his book but
his agonized contortions bore mute testimony to his guilt.
McCarty gazed at his old superior with a world of reproach.</p>

<p>“’Tis not what I expected from you, sir, after all these
years, but we’ll try to bear up under the injustice of it!
The papers came to us in a confidential way and since
all Parsons wants is to get them back again there’s no
harm done.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” The amusement had faded from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
inspector’s countenance. “Orbit’s house was broken into
that same night and he was chloroformed—!”</p>

<p>“May my right arm drop off this minute if we had
anything to do with that!” McCarty’s solemn tones held
the ring of truth. “I won’t say that I’ve not my own
suspicions about it, but they come to me since and they’re
all part and parcel of that notion I’ve got concerning the
whole case. However, getting back to Parsons, maybe
you’d like to look over what was stolen from his filing
case in that outrageous robbery. You’ll know then why
the housemaid and the page boy looked familiar to you.”</p>

<p>He handed the records of Parsons’ domestic staff
to the inspector and watched with a twinkle as the other
ran quickly through them. When his astonished comments
had ceased, he produced the manuscript notes but
drew no attention to the reference to fluorine gas, nor
did he mention the leaf he had torn from the encyclopædia
as he briefly recounted the interview with the eccentric
philanthropist on the previous day.</p>

<p>“I left asking myself was he a crook or a crank or a
saint on earth?” he concluded. “What’s your opinion
of him?”</p>

<p>“He may be a dreamer, with a lot of ideas for bettering
the world, that will never work out while we’re full of
original sin, but I think he’s a wonderful old character and
worthy of his family,” the inspector replied reflectively.
“I was talking to one of these psycho-analysts who is
going to lecture to us in the commissioner’s new school
the other day and he knew all about them; it seems they’re
celebrated among students of heredity as a shining example
of what good blood means. There are thousands
of ‘Parsons,’ I suppose, but I’m talking about the descendants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
of the first David Parsons and the old gentleman
we know is the last in the direct male line.”</p>

<p>“I know,” McCarty remarked. “Five governors
they’ve given to the New England states, eight clergymen
in America, fourteen foreign missionaries, eleven college
professors and two of them became college presidents,
and I can’t recall how many army and navy officers and
other big men. I’ve been looking them up a little, myself.”</p>

<p>“The devil you have!” The inspector stared. “Keeping
up with the commissioner’s latest innovations, eh? Did
you know that the Parsons have been contrasted by these
same students of heredity with another family that’s supposed
to be the worst on record?”</p>

<p>“I’ve no way of getting at things like those psycho-analysts,”
McCarty responded apologetically. “What
about this other family?”</p>

<p>“I’ve forgotten the name but they died out long ago, the
male members, anyway. Every kind of crime and general
crookedness was represented among them.—But we’re
wasting time. I suppose you want me to return these
papers to Parsons with the best excuse I can think of?”</p>

<p>“No. We’ve an hour to spare before we can do anything,
and Denny and me thought we’d take them to him
ourselves.” McCarty gazed ceilingward through the
wreaths of smoke. “Denny wants a little talk with him.”</p>

<p>“Every day,” Dennis laid down his book at last.
“Every day, in every way, my friend Timothy McCarty is
getting to be a better and better liar—”</p>

<p>“Denny, what have you got hold of now!” McCarty
flushed hotly.</p>

<p>“One of your new lesson books,” the other replied with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
immense satisfaction. “’Tis by a foreign gentleman with
a name like an Australian bushranger’s call—”</p>

<p>“I bought it by mistake, thinking it was about this
psycho-stuff too, because I couldn’t understand it!” McCarty
slammed the desk drawer upon the embarrassing
volume and turned to the inspector, who had risen.
“You’re going, sir? It may be a little past noon when
I call you up, but you’ll hear from me one way or the
other.”</p>

<p>Mutual recriminations of a more or less acrimonious
nature took place after the inspector’s departure but
they merely cleared the air. Finally McCarty remarked:</p>

<p>“I gave myself away as well as you about breaking
into the Parsons house, but that was only after you’d
told the inspector I was holding out on him, which I
wasn’t, having nothing to hold. As to getting at criminals
by way of science I’m not laughing at it, Denny, just
because I’m not on to it yet.”</p>

<p>“Nor me!” Dennis agreed. “Only to my mind, science
is a lot like spontaneous combustion; if you don’t handle
it careful it’ll work up its own heat and break out in a
blaze.”</p>

<p>“Like what?” McCarty paused with his hat halfway
to his head.</p>

<p>“Spontaneous combustion.” Dennis repeated. “When
anything that generates its own heat, like hay in a stable,
is shut up too long without air getting to it, it’s liable to
take fire by itself. That’s one of the first things ever
I learned when I joined the department.”</p>

<p>McCarty chuckled.</p>

<p>“And that’s your idea of science, is it? Maybe ’tis
as good as any other!—Now let’s go and ease the old
gentleman’s mind about his stolen property.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>But they were destined to meet with still another delay,
for on entering the west gate of the Mall they encountered
Mr. Gardner Sloane. The supercilious manner
had fallen from him and he greeted them with marked
cordiality.</p>

<p>“Horrible week we’ve been through, gentlemen!” he
declaimed. “Leaving the death of Orbit’s valet out of
it, a murder, a kidnapping and two robberies make a
frightful record to contemplate. I trust you are taking
every measure to protect us here? By gad, there’s no
telling where this thing will strike next!”</p>

<p>“Did you ever find your key to the gates?” McCarty
asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Confound it, no; had to have another one made!”
Sloane fumed. “Let me see, it was a week ago that I
missed it. I’d used it Saturday morning to enter the
east gate, I remember it distinctly, and I must have
dropped it near the Parsons house.—But I hope you’ll
tell your inspector that I depend on him to have a special
watch kept over our home; my father had a very bad
turn on Tuesday and if any excitement like a burglary
were to take place it might prove fatal.”</p>

<p>“Did you get a good nurse for him?” McCarty asked
solicitously. “The last one you had beat it, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Otto? Oh, he’s back; came Tuesday afternoon, fortunately.
Stupid ass but a splendid attendant and my
father’s used to him.—You won’t forget to have us properly
guarded?”</p>

<p>McCarty reassured him heartily and as they watched
him swing off toward the Avenue with a jaunty air Dennis
remarked:</p>

<p>“So Lindholm showed up again, and we never even
thought of it! On Tuesday, too! Do you suppose—?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“I’m through supposing!” McCarty interrupted.
“We’ll stop by and find out!”</p>

<p>The Sloane house, in spite of its almost oppressive
luxury, unmistakably betrayed the fact that a feminine
hand had been for long absent from its care and arrangement.
There was a cold, detached air about as
though those beneath its roof were transients with no
foothold and little interest of a personal nature. Dennis
voiced his impression when the ancient butler had hobbled
away to summon the nurse.</p>

<p>“’Tis like a hotel!” he whispered. “Grander than
most, but public like. If ’twas the old days I’d have been
minded to ask the old guy where the café was!”</p>

<p>“You’re not used to the high society we’ve been moving
in lately, Denny,” McCarty replied, adding, as soft but
heavy feet padded down the wide center staircase of the
reception hall: “Wisht! Here comes the squarehead!”</p>

<p>The man who entered almost before the words had
left his lips was a blond, massively built giant with an
up-standing brush of hair so light as to be almost colorless,
and sleepy blue eyes in a round face ruddy with
health.</p>

<p>“Ay Otto Lindholm.” He bent a mildly inquiring
gaze upon them. “You bane same mans dat go to
my missus?”</p>

<p>“Sure we are!” McCarty beamed in a friendly fashion.
“What the devil did you run away for? You’d nothing
to fear because of a row with Hughes!”</p>

<p>“My woman!” Otto shrugged as if that settled the
matter. “Ay tal her we better stay but she has a scare
on. You bane married, you know.”</p>

<p>“Neither of us, thank God!” McCarty replied devoutly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
“You quarreled with Hughes on Thursday night
a week ago, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Ay tal him he keep ’way from my woman or Ay
bane goin’ to fix him.” He spoke with stolid satisfaction.
“Next time he write latter to her Ay bane kick him
’roun’ de street like yaller dog. Dat’s all.”</p>

<p>His clear, placid eyes regarded them still in good-humored
inquiry and McCarty asked:</p>

<p>“When did you see him again?”</p>

<p>“De next night. Friday.”</p>

<p>“What-t!” The quiet answer had been all but overwhelming,
but Otto seemed unconscious of its portent.</p>

<p>“De next night,” he repeated patiently. “It bane yust
start to rain an’ he var sitting on stoop of house t’ree
street down, holting on wit’ bote han’s to stomach. He
var ver’ sick mans. Ay tal him Ay take him home but
he tal me go to hell. He look w’ite lak sheet, Ay t’ank
he bane soffer mooch but he say he bane goin’ walk it
off. Dat’s last Ay see of him.”</p>

<p>“You went on and left him sitting there? That would
be about eight o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ’bout eight. Ay stay to see can Ay halp him
but he get oop an’ walk ’way. Ay t’ank to mysalf den he
look lak deat’ but Ay did not guess it var poison. He
tal me he bane get sick at dinner an’ Ay t’ank he yust
eat too mooch.” Otto shook his head. “Hughes var
bad mans but murder is not so good! Dat Calabar bean
he bane get here in de Mall, sure!”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“Is</span> that the poor beast you told me about?” It was an
hour later, and McCarty and Dennis were coming
down the steps of the Parsons residence. The latter
pointed across the street to where Max was prowling up
and down the court.</p>

<p>“Yes. He’ll go on like that till he drops in his tracks.”
A certain note of grimness had crept into McCarty’s tone.
“I wonder if Orbit went down to the boat to see his
friend off? I’d like a word with him if Sir Philip has
gone.”</p>

<p>“We’ve had words, in a manner of speaking, with more
than one this morning!” Dennis remarked. “We know
as much now as we did before but we’ve not gone a
step forward and ’tis near noon.... Look at Little
Fu Moy!”</p>

<p>The Chinese boy, looking, in his drab, everyday attire,
like some dun-colored moth, had emerged from the side
door of the house where he was employed and approached
the dog, holding a bit of cake out in one brown little
hand, but Max’s somber eyes showed no glint of recognition
and he swung out of the child’s way, staggering in
sheer weakness until he regained his poise.</p>

<p>Fu Moy stood still, his hand dropped to his side, and
the piece of cake falling to the pavement of the court.</p>

<p>“You go ring the bell, Denny, and ask for Mr. Orbit,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
McCarty directed. “I’ll be with you in a minute. If
Ching Lee takes you to him say you’ll wait for me, that
I’ve something more to ask him.”</p>

<p>Dennis obeyed but when Ching Lee appeared and he
voiced his query the Oriental shook his head.</p>

<p>“Mr. Orbit is not at home. He has gone down to
the wharf with Sir Philip, whose ship sails at noon.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll wait for him.” Dennis announced firmly.
“My friend McCarty will be along in a little while.
When Mr. Orbit gets back, tell him the two of us are
here.”</p>

<p>Ching Lee showed him to the library and with a bow
left him, and Dennis seated himself, feeling regretfully
of the pipe in his pocket. What McCarty had in mind he
could not conjecture and there was no telling when Orbit
might return to find him waiting there without an idea
in his head and afraid to open his mouth for fear of
balling up the game.</p>

<p>Had Mac just been kidding when he told the inspector
he’d know by noon whether his notion was fact or not?
He’d learned nothing since but a lot of corroborative
detail about things that didn’t matter, anyway. Why on
earth was he hanging around outside, fooling with the
dog?</p>

<p>Time crawled. Twenty minutes had passed by the
great old grandfather’s clock in the corner and still
McCarty did not put in an appearance. Dennis rose
at last and tiptoed out across the hall and down to the
card-room, where he cautiously opened the side door leading
to the court. There stood McCarty, chinning and
laughing with the little Chink as if he’d not a care in
the world!</p>

<p>Dennis took a tentative step forward, but at that moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
McCarty turned with a pat on the shoulder to
Fu Moy and started for the rear of the house. Dennis
was forced to beat a hasty retreat lest the boy find
him spying.</p>

<p>What could Mac have found to talk about to the lad?
Dennis knew him too well to be taken in by that idly
jocular air, and he’d not be wasting a minute at this stage
of the game. Could it be from somebody in Orbit’s
household, after all, that Hughes had got his death-dose
and poor Lucette that puff of poisoned air? Could
the boy Horace be even now hidden in some secret corner
of Chinatown or the French quarter?</p>

<p>He had little opportunity to speculate further, for the
front door opened and after a moment Orbit’s tones came
to him raised in singsong Chinese. Little Fu Moy replied
and then the master of the house entered.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Riordan. Where is McCarty? Fu
Moy says you both wished to see me. What can I do
for you?”</p>

<p>For a horrible moment Dennis’ tongue clove to the
roof of his mouth and then an inspiration came.</p>

<p>“Mac has something to ask you, Mr. Orbit, but he
was stopped outside. He’ll be in right away. ’Twas
about that chloroforming the other night that I wanted
to see you. You woke up sick and found nothing had
been touched, but there was the bottle and the towel, and
the side door open downstairs. Did you happen to
notice anything else?”</p>

<p>“Only proof that there were two of them,” Orbit
responded thoughtfully. “I forgot to mention that to the
inspector. One had big hands, fat, and a trifle soft, but
the other’s were thin and strong with a wiry grip and
a broken finger on the left one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>“You don’t tell me!” Dennis ejaculated and his own
left hand promptly fumbled with his coat pocket as
though seeking cover there. Then in confusion it dropped
to his side again. “And how might you be knowing that?
Sure, the inspector said you’d no time to move, before the
towel was clapped down over your face!”</p>

<p>“They had left their marks behind them.” Orbit
laughed. “Fat Hands had raised my windows higher
and he must have been the one who actually drugged
me, for Broken Finger was nervous and during that operation
he gripped the post at the foot of my bed so tightly
that the impression was plainly left in the satiny finish
of the wood. The prints could have been made by none
of the household when they came in response to my
ring, for Ching Lee’s hands are very long and slender,
Jean’s as thin as claws and André’s fat but small. Fu
Moy did not wake up and I would not permit Sir Philip
or his man to be disturbed.”</p>

<p>“Maybe there was more than two of them,” Dennis
suggested hopefully. “Was there nothing else but just
them finger marks? The bureau don’t take so much
stock in that kind of evidence any more, what with
the new science and such.”</p>

<p>“New science?” Orbit raised his brows. “Do you
mean the crime-detecting machines imported from some
of the European capitals? But that was some years
ago.”</p>

<p>“No, sir.” Dennis’ thoughts went swiftly back to
more than one experience he had had with automatic informers
in company with McCarty during earlier days.
“This is no test of your breathing, nor pulse, nor sweat-glands,
nor yet how quick you can think when a lie
comes in handy. ’Tis the crime itself that tells nowadays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
what manner of man committed it and what kind
of people he sprung from; I’ve no doubt but that soon
they’ll have it down so pat they can tell a guy’s color and
religion and politics by the turn of a knife or the course
of a bullet! It’s a wonder anybody got hung at all
in the old days!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Orbit?” McCarty unannounced appeared at last
in the doorway. “Sorry if I’ve kept you waiting. Has
Sir Philip Devereux gone?”</p>

<p>“He sailed less than an hour ago.” Orbit eyed him
inquiringly. “Your associate tells me you have something
to ask me.”</p>

<p>“About Hughes, it was. He’d not been looking so well
lately. Do you know had he been taking any medicine?”</p>

<p>“Really, I couldn’t say.” He shrugged. “It didn’t
occur to me to ask him!”</p>

<p>“That’s that, then!” McCarty seemed lost in thought
for a minute. “Who is it drinks milk in the household?”</p>

<p>“Milk?” Orbit smiled. “Fu Moy, perhaps, but you
will have to ask him. The only one I know to be fond
of it is Vite, the monkey; it is one of his main articles
of diet.”</p>

<p>As though the mention of his name had summoned
him, a little brownish-gray shape sidled in over the doorsill,
paused for a moment and then sprang through the
air to land lightly on Orbit’s shoulder and sit chattering
impertinently at the intruders.</p>

<p>“Silence, Vite! Where are your manners?” His
owner stroked him gently. “Why do you ask about the
milk, McCarty?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t of any matter, sir. The medical examiner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
was saying that ’twas only in medicine or milk the
Calabar bean powder could be dissolved.”</p>

<p>Orbit moved with a slight trace of impatience.</p>

<p>“Surely such minor details are unimportant just at this
time, anxious as I am to have the mystery concerning
Hughes’ death cleared up! Nothing can restore him
or that poor girl who died so strangely in my house,
but there is Horace Goddard! This is the fourth day
since his inexplicable disappearance and his father tells
me that no effort has been made to approach him for
ransom. If the boy has not been killed in some accident
he may be in horrible danger! He is delicate, he could
not long endure hardships, privation.” Orbit hesitated
and then went on: “I don’t know whether the suggestion
may be worth anything or not, but has his own home
been searched thoroughly? It is an enormous, rambling
old house with innumerable storerooms and closets upstairs—I
have remembered them since I was a mere lad.
Horace is a solitary, meditative little chap, fond of getting
away by himself. Isn’t it possible that he may have gone
up to some portion of the attic and either fastened himself
in or been locked away there by some one who didn’t
know he was around? Finding he couldn’t get out he may
have been frightened, fainted,—the possibilities are too
awful to be imagined!”</p>

<p>“No, there’s no chance of that, for every inch of the
house has been gone over a dozen times, but it may be,
of course, that he met with an accident somewhere and
the body hasn’t come to light yet; the inspector was saying
something like that awhile ago. The lad could have
been dead even before he was missed by Trafford; you
recall the tutor coming here to ask for him that day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
whilst we were talking to you? The coal men had been
after getting in your supply—?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” Orbit nodded quickly, impatience at McCarty’s
garrulity evident in his voice now. “Most inconvenient
time, too, just before the arrival of my guests!
I had ordered it days before.—But these idle speculations
about Horace won’t help any, I suppose; the Goddards
themselves can scarcely be more anxious than I am for
some real results from this investigation!”</p>

<p>“Well, the inspector’ll be around in a little while, if
you’re home.” McCarty signaled to Dennis with a jerk
of his head. “There’s something in his mind he wants
to talk to you about, and maybe you can help him.
We’ve not made much headway, and that’s a fact, but
’tis the worst case ever the department handled.”</p>

<p>There was an injured note in his voice and Orbit responded
with sympathetic tact:</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’re doing all you can and I shall be glad
to see the inspector or either of you at any time.” He
pressed the bell and as Ching Lee threw open the door
he added: “The medical examiner has come to no definite
conclusion about the girl’s death? If it was really gas
of some sort it seems odd its nature can’t be determined.
But I speak ignorantly, of course; I know little or
nothing of chemistry in any form.... I shall wait to
hear from the inspector.”</p>

<p>“I don’t get you this morning at all!” Dennis remarked
plaintively when the door of Orbit’s house had
closed behind them. “While I waited I saw you kidding
the little heathen out in the side court and then you
went to the back, and Orbit came in and I had to string
him. For what did we go there in the first place?
You’d little to ask him and you got less for it, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
you did finally come in! Is it stalling around for time,
you are?”</p>

<p>“There’ll be no more stalling, Denny!” There was a
new note in McCarty’s voice. “’Twas little I got from
Orbit himself, but we’ll go to Goddard now. I want to
use his telephone.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you use Orbit’s?” Dennis demanded.
Then a light broke over his face. “’Tis the inspector
you’ll be calling up and there’s them in that house back
there—! Mac, for the love of the saints, have you
found out something? Have you struck it at last?”</p>

<p>The dog Max who was lying in the patch of sunlight
that filtered down between the houses, raised his
head at the eager expectancy of Dennis’ tone and McCarty
glanced at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“’Twas not me that struck anything, Denny, and ’tis
only a guess yet but ’twas <em>it</em> ought to have struck <em>me</em> before
this!” he replied. “We’ll have a little while to wait,
and I’ll thank you to keep Goddard and that Trafford
talking and not leave them out of your sight whilst
I’m telephoning; I don’t want either of them listening
in!”</p>

<p>“Then ’tis one of them, as well as somebody in Orbit’s
house—!” Dennis gaped in amazement. “Mac, what
kind of a devilish plot is it? You said last night ’twas
too sickening to talk about—!”</p>

<p>“’Tis worse!” McCarty interrupted tersely. “Let be
till we see what comes!”</p>

<p>Winch the butler, looking more aged and fragile than
ever, ushered them into the drawing-room where Goddard
presently appeared followed by Trafford. The stout little
man had changed markedly in the past few days; his
eyes were dim and the flesh of his face hung in folds as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
though deflated, while his voice had the trembling overtone
of that of an old man.</p>

<p>“You—you have news for us, McCarty? Some word
has reached you of—of Horace?”</p>

<p>“I think I know where he will be in a little while, Mr.
Goddard,” McCarty replied quietly. “I’ll have to ask
you to wait, though, till the inspector gets here, and I’ll
have to ’phone him. Can I use the one in your smoking-room?
I want to be dead sure it’s private for I’ve got to
talk confidential.—Thanks, Trafford, I know the way.”</p>

<p>Waiting only for Goddard’s nod he cast a quick admonitory
glance at Dennis and hastened away. The latter
cast about wildly in his mind for a safe topic to pursue,
but the burden was lifted from him.</p>

<p>“What is it, Riordan? For God’s sake, what does
McCarty mean?” Goddard turned to him.</p>

<p>“I’ve no notion,” Dennis replied, truthfully enough.
“He’s been working on something for the last day or
two while I was on—on other duty, but I expect things
will be moving now. You’ve heard nothing yourself?”</p>

<p>“Nothing!” Goddard raised a shaking hand to his
forehead. “I tell you, Riordan, we can’t—we can’t endure
much more of this! If my boy were in his grave
we would at least know it and learn somehow to bear
it but the uncertainty is driving us mad! Unless we know
the truth soon I shall lose my wife, too!”</p>

<p>“We’ll know.” Dennis spoke with the assurance of
utter conviction. “Mac’s not one to start anything he
can’t finish and I’ve worked on too many cases with him
not to know the signs. If he says the lad will be found
in a little while he means it but—but maybe it’ll be sick
or something he’ll be. Worrying, you see, and being
away from home—!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>Words failed him, for he had read in that ominous
quietude of McCarty’s voice a hint of trouble yet to come.
He floundered desperately in a tender-hearted attempt to
pave the way. The situation was saved for him by the
sudden reappearance of McCarty himself in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Denny, go out and call Yost in; the inspector has
instructions for him.” The latent excitement had intensified
in his tone. “Don’t tell the whole block what
you’re doing, either!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, myself!” Dennis retorted, preparing
nevertheless to obey. “Shall I take his place?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking!” McCarty nodded approval.
“He’ll have a message for you when he comes out and
’twill be all right to do what he says. The other night
in my rooms when we were starting out to pay a couple
of calls I gave you something to carry; did you think
to bring it with you now?”</p>

<p>The revolver! Dennis started violently and one hand
sought his hip pocket involuntarily as he nodded.</p>

<p>“All right. You’ll know what to do with it after
you’ve talked to Yost. Send him in.”</p>

<p>Dennis departed, found the headquarters’ man patrolling
listlessly on the sidewalk and delivered the message.
Then he paced from gate to gate in a daze of bewildered
thought. Things were indeed moving. He could not
fathom what was in McCarty’s mind, but he felt a grim
portent in the very air of the sunlit, semi-deserted block,
like the shuddering silence before a blast.</p>

<p>The elder Sloane returned; the housemaid from Mrs.
Bellamy’s who had taken charge of little Maude immediately
after Wednesday’s tragedy went out upon an
errand and came back before Yost left the Goddard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
house. When he reached Dennis’ side his former listlessness
had vanished.</p>

<p>“Who’s gone out of the Mall?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Only a hired girl from Mrs. Bellamy’s, and she came
in again.” Dennis replied. “What is it? Mac said
you’d tell me what to do, and he asked had I a gun with
me. I have.”</p>

<p>“Then go take the east gate.” Yost pointed. “Open
it if any one wants to come in but let no one out if you
have to drill them full of holes! Get me?”</p>

<p>“’Tis the clearest thing I’ve heard this day!” Dennis
averred. “I’ll do no drilling but there’ll no one pass me!
What in hell is doing, do you know?”</p>

<p>“Only that the inspector’s coming as fast as the chief’s
own car can get here and he’s bringing a young army with
him! It looks like the end of it, Riordan!—Hey, there
goes the Bellamy butler! I’ll have to head him off, for
I’m taking the west gate myself. There’s somebody
wanting to get in yours.”</p>

<p>Dennis hurried to the gate opening on the Avenue and
with much ceremony admitted an open touring car in
which sat a young lady so bewilderingly beautiful that
he gaped after her in respectful admiration until she
disappeared in the Parsons house. Was that the old
gentleman’s niece? He was recalled to his present duties
only when the chauffeur turned and drove straight toward
him once more, halting only a bare few feet away.</p>

<p>“Hi, there! Open the gate!”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” Dennis retorted firmly. “Orders
from police headquarters. Them that gets in, stays in.”</p>

<p>“Yah! You green rookie! I’m Mr. Parsons’ chauffeur,
if that means anything to you, and I’m in a hurry!”</p>

<p>“Then you’re going to be disappointed.” With a gingerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
reluctance which would have meant sudden death
had he been faced by an earnest antagonist, Dennis
produced his revolver. “’Twould mean nothing if you
drove the chariot of the Angel Gabriel, you’d not get
through that gate!”</p>

<p>A wordy combat ensued interrupted only by the appearance
on the Avenue side of the barrier of young Mr.
Brinsley Sloane. He hesitated, turning slightly pale at
sight of Dennis’ formidable weapon. The latter called
out peremptorily:</p>

<p>“’Round to the other gate if you want to get in!
This guy’ll get out if you open this one! Police orders!”</p>

<p>“Really!” Brinsley Sloane stared through his huge-rimmed
glasses. “This is extraordinary! What has the
fellow done, officer?”</p>

<p>Dennis swelled visibly at the appellation.</p>

<p>“Nothing yet,” he admitted. “He won’t, either, unless
he’s wishful to croak!”</p>

<p>“Is the fellow mad?” Young Sloane addressed the
chauffeur who, scenting an ally, broke into injured explanations.
The argument became a triangular affair
although the scion of the Sloanes remained discreetly
on the neutral ground beyond the gate. It was ended
at last by a subdued hubbub at the farther one. Dennis
turned to behold the inspector drive slowly in with several
familiar officials of the department; his car was followed
by a larger one packed with husky men and bristling with
long-handled shovels.</p>

<p>Dennis uttered a startled exclamation and Brinsley
Sloane let himself hurriedly in with his key while the
Parsons’ chauffeur no longer exhibited any desire to
depart. Martin appeared suddenly from nowhere and
addressed the astounded deputy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>“Beat it, Riordan; Mac wants you! I’ll take over your
job.”</p>

<p>Dennis needed no second bidding. He set off at a
shambling run, unconsciously brandishing his revolver as
he went and Goddard, Trafford and McCarty emerged
from the house to meet him. He noticed as in a daze
that the tutor braced his employer with an almost filial
manner and the older man leaned heavily upon him, pallid
but composed.</p>

<p>The men with the shovels were piling out of the second
car and he saw that they carried in addition enormous
sooty baskets. His eyes turned wonderingly to McCarty
as the inspector hurried up.</p>

<p>“All set, Mac! The boys are posted all around the
walls. What do you want done?”</p>

<p>“Open that coal chute first!” McCarty pointed to the
square iron plate like a trap-door in the center of the
side court, over which Max was still hovering. “Then
send your men down in Orbit’s cellar to dig like hell!
There’s thirty tons to be moved by the ten of them in an
hour and a thousand dollars from Mr. Goddard to the
guy that takes out the last shovelful. Go to it!”</p>

<p>Ching Lee had appeared in the front door of the Orbit
house and Jean at the side one, while André peered from
the kitchen window. All at once the houseman was
brushed aside and Orbit strode out.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of this?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“We’re going to move your coal, Mr. Orbit,—the coal
that was put in so quick the very hour that Horace Goddard
disappeared!” McCarty replied. He turned abruptly
to the group who were lifting the cover of the chute. As
it rose and then fell back ringing on the pavement, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
long-drawn howl broke upon the air; Max, tense and
quivering, was gazing down into the aperture and McCarty
motioned toward him.</p>

<p>“’Twas him and not me got the hunch first, inspector.
’Twas the lad’s pal, here—Max!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br>
<span class="fs80">THE BLACK PYRE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“Good God</span>!” Orbit exclaimed in horrified accents.
“You don’t mean that the little fellow tumbled
down the chute! That he was buried beneath the coal!—Goddard,
my old friend, what can I say to you! Surely
this is only a vague supposition, a last resort! It would
be too dreadful, too pitiful!”</p>

<p>Goddard’s face worked but he was unable to reply
and Orbit turned to the men who, with baskets and
shovels, were filing around the rear of the house.</p>

<p>“I’ll add a thousand to Mr. Goddard’s! Work as you
never did before!—Inspector, can such a fearful thing
have occurred? It is incredible! How could the little
chap have fallen down to the cellar without being seen? I
suppose any outcry he might have made would have been
drowned by the noise of the coal itself but—oh, it is too
utterly horrible!”</p>

<p>His shocked, broken tones trailed away into silence
and then from below there ascended through the open
chute the ring of shovels and the clatter of coal falling
rhythmically into the baskets. A tortured groan was
forced from Goddard’s lips. Max crouched with his forepaws
hanging over the edge of the aperture and his
nose low between them, the hair rising in a ridge along
his back and a soft, anxious whine pulsing from his
throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>Dennis turned away with a shiver, and saw that Gardner
Sloane had joined his son on the fringe of the group.
Snape and the maids of Mrs. Bellamy’s staff were gathered
in a little knot just behind, with the Parsons’ chauffeur,
Danny Sayre the page boy, and the aged butler of
the Sloanes, while Benjamin Parsons himself had
emerged upon the steps of his home and the lower windows
of the Goddard house were thronged with the servants.
From a window just above Orbit’s conservatory
the staring face of little Fu Moy looked down in shrinking
wonder.</p>

<p>The rhythmic, dreadful scrape and rumble from beneath
their feet went on as though it would never end.
Goddard swayed weakly but Trafford flung an arm about
his shoulders. The inspector had replied to Orbit with
noncommittal gravity and now they conversed together in
an aside, while Dennis edged over to McCarty.</p>

<p>“Why ever didn’t you tell me?” he whispered. “No
wonder you said ’twas fair sickening to think of, Mac!
If the poor boy’s found down there ’twill be one crime
that’s no crime at all! How did you know?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know!” McCarty responded candidly. “’Tis
the only guess, though, that will cover the facts as they
come to me, but Max needed none; I’m banking on the
dog’s instinct, Denny.”</p>

<p>“Look at the back of him! It makes my own hair
lift the hat from my head to see it!” Dennis shivered
again. “Will they never have done with the shoveling?
I could scream like a woman!”</p>

<p>Some of the Bellamy servants had indeed begun to sob
hysterically but they quieted at a look from McCarty.
Parsons was slowly crossing the street and his chauffeur
stepped aside for him. Dennis saw that several older<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
men from the detective bureau were circulating unobtrusively
among the different groups and two of the officials
who had come in the car with the inspector approached
him now. He presented them to Orbit and the
interrupted consultation was resumed now between the
four.</p>

<p>Dennis surreptitiously took out his watch, an ancient
affair of the turnip variety. The men had been at work
for nearly forty minutes; he recalled the blowing of the
one o’clock whistles when Martin came to relieve him
at the east gate. In a little while, now, they would
know the worst! If only the dog would stop whining!</p>

<p>He looked at Trafford and the young man met his
glance with a stare of agonized inquiry but the man
he was supporting reeled and he braced himself for a
firmer hold. Then Benjamin Parsons stepped quietly to
Goddard’s other side.</p>

<p>“Lean on me, my friend.” He spoke in the gentlest of
accents. “I am old but strong, an elder brother here to
lend a hand. We will wait, and pray.”</p>

<p>Goddard’s dull eyes filmed and he rested his hand in
the arm offered, saying no word. A lump rose in Dennis’
throat.</p>

<p>“Mac, for the love of God, will they finish this? ’Tis
more than mortal can bear! I’ve dug at a fallen wall with
the bare hands of me and the best lads of my company
buried under it, but ’twas not as bad as this! Orbit’s all
in, and no wonder!”</p>

<p>Henry Orbit had turned and was gazing at the coal
chute in horrified fascination, his highly-bred face quivering
and eyes glowing with an awful intensity. As though
drawn toward it against his will he advanced a step or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
two and the officials also moved forward. Then he
seemed for the first time to behold McCarty.</p>

<p>“Had you the least suspicion of this when you came to
me an hour or so ago?” he asked, his voice a mere toneless
breath. “Why did you not tell me? I have three
strong men in my house and I myself would have led
them! Is this your doing?”</p>

<p>“The inspector brought them, Mr. Orbit.” McCarty
replied. “I told you he was coming in a little while but
he don’t always tell me what he’s got planned.”</p>

<p>“He should at least have notified me!” Orbit ran his
hand through his dark, graying hair. “I could have
started the work.—But this is sheer madness! The child
cannot have met such a horrible death!”</p>

<p>“We’ll know soon enough.” McCarty’s tone held a
note of sternness. “In a minute or two more—!”</p>

<p>As though his words were a signal, the clank and rattling
patter from below ceased abruptly and a moment of
electrified stillness ensued. Then it was broken by a rising
murmur of hoarse voices which were in turn drowned
by the sustained hail of coal being flung in every direction.</p>

<p>Orbit uttered a stifled exclamation and then stood immovable
as a second groan forced its way from Goddard.
One of the Bellamy maids shrieked aloud. Then the
noise from the cellar ceased once more and the dog rose
slowly lifting his nose into the air. A low, wailing cry
broke from him. At that moment a grimy head and
shoulders rose in the opening of the coal chute and a
hoarse, shuddering voice addressed McCarty.</p>

<p>“We’ve—found it, sir!”</p>

<p>The various groups merged and swept toward the
aperture then shrank back again in horror. A hubbub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
of subdued cries came from among them but Eustace
Goddard did not hear. His head had fallen forward, his
knees sagged and doubled and he slumped, insensible, between
the two who supported him. Instantly two plainclothes
men were beside them and the unconscious man
was carried into his house.</p>

<p>It was significant that neither McCarty, the inspector,
nor the two officials had moved to assist him. Now as
Orbit, after his first horrified recoil from the brusque announcement,
turned and hurried into the house they followed,
with Dennis bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Aware of his doubtful status in the eyes of the strange
officials he remained discreetly in the background and
when he caught up to the little group they were standing
in the rear hall before the open door leading to the
cellar steps, with Orbit at their head and Ching Lee,
André and Jean by the pantry.</p>

<p>Orbit was staring down into the brazen, orange glow
of the electric lights in the cellar, listening to the shuffle
of feet and the murmur of rough voices lowered in pity.
Then there came a slow tread and two of the shovelers
appeared bearing between them something slender and
pathetically small wrapped in a heavy dark cloth.</p>

<p>As they ascended the stairs the servants and even the
officials drew back but Orbit stood his ground with no
sound or movement. Only his eyes followed the men
with their burden as they mounted, passing him so closely
that he could have reached out and touched them. Then
he turned and passed upstairs to his sitting-room, followed
by his uninvited guests.</p>

<p>The murmur outside rose to a swelling chorus of cries
and then was abruptly shut out by the closing of the
door. Orbit turned with both hands raised to his head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
and a shuddering groan came from his shaking lips.</p>

<p>“This is horrible!” he gasped. “Gentlemen, I shall ask
you for an explanation, but not at this moment—I am too
inexpressibly shocked—”</p>

<p>“The explaining will have to be done now, Orbit!”
McCarty, after a glance at his superior, stepped forward.
“’Twill not come from us, either!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Orbit demanded. “Surely you
are not mad enough to insinuate that I knew that the
child was lying there? It is monstrous! Do you think
I would not have let you know?”</p>

<p>He turned to the inspector.</p>

<p>“Inspector, when did you learn what had become of the
poor little fellow?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t; it was McCarty,” the inspector admitted
frankly. “He told me this morning that he might have
news for me by noon but until he telephoned ordering the
squad of men with shovels I hadn’t an inkling.”</p>

<p>“Then you—?” Orbit turned again to McCarty.</p>

<p>“’Twas the dog first put it in my head by hovering
all the time about that coal chute,” the latter responded.
There was a new note in his voice as he went on. “It
struck me too, as kind of funny you’d be having that coal
put in an hour before your party, dirtying the place
all up; even if it had been ordered you could have sent
it away again for you’d not be lighting up your furnace
for weeks yet. I found then that you never ordered it
till half an hour before it got here and you’d ’phoned
three times, at that, to hurry it up, yet you told me this
morning that it had been arranged four days ago. About
twenty minutes before you sent for it first you went down
to the kitchen and got a glass of milk from André. Did
you drink it yourself, Henry Orbit?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>“I did not!” Orbit’s eyes seemed burning into his face.
“It was for Vite, the monkey!”</p>

<p>“But Vite was locked up at the top of the house to be
out of the way of the party and Ching Lee had the only
key; Fu Moy told me so.”</p>

<p>“Fu Moy is only a child and does not understand
English well; Vite was not locked up until just before
my guests arrived. What are you trying to insinuate?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I’m telling you what I know. Fu Moy
understands a lot more than you think, Orbit! What
time did Horace Goddard come over to see you Tuesday
afternoon? If that glass of milk was for the monkey,
why didn’t you ring for it instead of going yourself to
the kitchen; was it because you wanted nobody to know
the lad was here? What did you put in that milk, Orbit,
to make Horace unconscious or kill him, the way you
poisoned Hughes? I know from André how you got all
the servants out of the kitchen and pantries after, so you
could get the lad’s body down to the cellar without being
seen but <em>why</em> did you do it? What reason had you
for bringing such a horrible death on the child who’d done
you no harm? What reason did you have for murdering
the valet who’d looked out for your comfort for more
than twenty years? Why did you put poison gas made
from the formula you bought from Hinton Sherard into
the Bellamy baby’s toy balloon to kill both her and her
nurse? How did you fix it to burst when it did and
what chance had you to pump the gas into it? You’re
far from crazy, Orbit! Why did you take the lives of
these people you had no grudge against, no reason for
wanting out of the way? Was it because of the blood
that’s in you from generations back urging you on? Answer
me that, Henry Orbit!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>“I shall answer nothing—to you.” Orbit’s dark eyes
blazed but his voice was dangerously calm. “You admit
that I am not insane; I cannot say as much for you in
the face of these monstrous accusations!—Inspector, if
you are in authority at this highly irregular proceeding,
am I to understand that I am formally charged with this
atrocious series of crimes? Am I to consider myself
under arrest?”</p>

<p>Inspector Druet glanced uncertainly at McCarty and
the latter nodded, a world of mingled demand and entreaty
in the slight gesture. The inspector hesitated for
a moment and then drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“You are!” he replied. “I arrest you, Henry Orbit,
for the murders of Alfred Hughes, Horace Goddard and
Lucette Guerin!”</p>

<p>The two other officials after a startled glance between
them advanced one on each side of Orbit, but he shrugged
and took a step forward.</p>

<p>“That being the case, I shall not say another word.
Now you may play on this ridiculous farce for the moment.
In the meantime, may I ask your indulgence for
a few minutes? I desire merely to seat myself at
that desk over there and write a short note to the one
person in the world most interested, besides myself, in
this extraordinary situation. I shall seal and address
the envelope and leave it upon the desk, for you to deliver
at your discretion. Lock the drawers of the desk if you
will; I can assure you, however, that I have no intention
of taking any weapon from them to defend myself or attempt
assault upon you!”</p>

<p>The contempt in his tone was galling and even the
inspector winced beneath it, so compelling and dominant
was the personality of the man before him. He nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>“Write your note, Mr. Orbit, only make it short. If
the news of this gets out before we can take you downtown
all the reserves in the city couldn’t protect you!”</p>

<p>Dennis turned in stupefied amazement to McCarty, but
the latter was watching Orbit who had seated himself at
the desk. He wrote, not hurriedly but without hesitation;
a faintly amused smile curved his mobile lips, and when
he had finished he sealed the envelope with a steady hand,
wrote a name and a single line beneath it, propped it
against the inkwell and rose.</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen, I am at your disposal,” he said. “I
am ready to accompany you—<em>if you can find me</em>!”</p>

<p>The last words were uttered in a tone of ringing challenge
and his hand slipped beneath the edge of the desk.
On the instant, before the five men grouped before him
could move or draw a breath the room was filled with
rolling billows of black, foul smoke which belched forth
in clouds from around the wainscoting of the wall as
from the mouth of a volcano, obliterating everything
about them.</p>

<p>Startled, warning exclamations came from the two officials
and a cry from the inspector:</p>

<p>“To the windows! Look out for poison gas!”</p>

<p>McCarty had groped grimly forward but Dennis was
more thoroughly at home in the crisis than he had been
at any time since the inception of the affair. He shouted
directions and encouragement, darting about as unconcernedly
and with as much certitude as though his eyes
could penetrate the murky, opaque gloom which enveloped
him.</p>

<p>The sound of their own rushing footsteps and the
successive crash of furniture as the officials lunged against
it drowned out all others until close at hand a door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
slammed and a mocking chuckle of laughter seemed to
drift back to them.</p>

<p>“He’s gone!” One of the officials gasped, as he found
a window at last and flung it open.</p>

<p>“He won’t go far!” the inspector retorted grimly.
“Find all the windows and doors and let’s get a draught
through! I want that letter he wrote!”</p>

<p>In the rush of fresh air which came swirling in, the
room rapidly cleared and they saw that it was indeed
empty of any presence save their own but the white square
of the envelope tilted against the inkwell was plainly discernible
and the inspector seized upon it.</p>

<p>Choking, strangling, with smarting, streaming eyes,
he peered closely at the inscription and then threw up his
head.</p>

<p>“Great guns! It’s addressed to McCarty!”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">McCarty</span> stumbled forward and took the envelope
held out to him, turning to the window where he
bent forward for the rush of cool air to play over his
face. It was addressed simply to: “Ex-Roundsman McCarty”
and the second line read: “Delivered by hand.”
Slitting it open he glanced quickly down the few lines
it contained and then at his companions.</p>

<p>“’Tis for all of us, I’m thinking,” he said. “Listen!</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“‘My dear McCarty. It has been a pleasure to meet
such a man as you and we part with regret, at least on
my side. You are quite correct in your deductions as
far as you have expounded them and I regret that I cannot
wait to hear you reconstruct your complete case but
time presses. The last drawer of this desk at which I
write has a false bottom; remove it and you will find a
portion of my diary for the past fortnight, placed there
in readiness for this eventuality. I bequeath it to you for
your further information and in most sincere admiration,
for where I go I may take nothing material with me,
although I shall not leave my body behind. I am not going
to death but to annihilation. Checkmate!</p>

<p class="right">
“‘Henry Orbit.’”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“What does he mean?” the inspector demanded. “What
kind of an escape has he planned? Not take his body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
with him and yet not leave it behind? What’s that about
‘annihilation’?”</p>

<p>“We may know for ourselves if we stand here guessing
about it instead of stopping him!” McCarty thrust the
letter into his pocket and made for the door beyond which
the two French servants and the Chinese one had halted.
“He’s planned to destroy himself entirely, body and all,
and if it’s by blowing the whole house up I’d not be surprised!
Come on!”</p>

<p>The others hurried after him but in the hall he paused
to confront Ching Lee.</p>

<p>“’Twas the man you worked for, Orbit, who was the
murderer!” he announced. “You knew that, though;
you suspected it from the first, after the queer way Hughes
took sick from drinking the medicine Orbit mixed for
him before dinner! That’s why you went next morning
dressed like a Chinese laborer down to the quarter where
Hughes died, to get what dope you could about it! If
you don’t want to get pinched for being accessory, you
come clean! Which way did he go just now?”</p>

<p>“I did not see.” Ching Lee’s face had betrayed no
slightest flicker of emotion and his tone was perfectly
composed. “I came upstairs only when the shouts and
the odor of smoke led me to think that the house was on
fire. I saw no one, nothing.”</p>

<p>“Where is his laboratory? Where is it that he locks
himself away sometimes, a place that none of the rest
of you enters?” McCarty rapped out the questions like
shots from an automatic. “There’s not a minute to spare!
Is it upstairs or down?”</p>

<p>Ching Lee was silent, but Jean with chattering teeth
spoke up suddenly:</p>

<p>“It is upstairs! I see him when I reach the head of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
staircase. He rush’ from that room through all the
smoke and he is laughing! Then he mount to the next
floor and on above, and in the attic there is a room which
none but he may enter, which he guards with a heavy
steel door—!”</p>

<p>“Show us where it is!” McCarty ordered. “That’s
where I fell down. I might have figured that a guy
with his brains would have looked out for everything,
even failure, and planned a way out for himself!”</p>

<p>He started on a shambling trot for the back stairs,
with the others crowding after, but Jean slipped past him
and leaped up three steps at a time. Past the guest rooms
and servants’ quarters to the storerooms and the attic
above the searchers hurried, pausing only before a small
wooden door.</p>

<p>“I thought you said ’twas made of steel!” McCarty
turned the handle and then put his shoulder to a panel.
“We’ll have to break through.”</p>

<p>“It is but the false one, the cover,” explained Jean.
“Just beyond is the real door of steel.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure he came this way? There’s nowhere
else he could be hiding?” McCarty glanced at the
Frenchman and then turned to his companions. “Stand
back! We’ll have this down!”</p>

<p>But the small door was stouter than it looked and it
required the combined efforts of Dennis and one of the
officials as well before it yielded and crashed inward, only
to lean, as Jean had said, against a second door a foot
or two beyond, which presented to their impatient gaze
a solid sheet of tempered steel.</p>

<p>“We’d never get through that except with soup and
God knows what’s beyond it that would blow us all into
the next world!” McCarty exclaimed. “Inspector, will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
you ’phone for an expert from headquarters? There’s
nothing to do but wait. We know where he is, though;
that’s some comfort!”</p>

<p>The inspector hurried downstairs and the others
grouped themselves before the wall of steel separating
them from that which lay on the other side, after clearing
away the débris of the wrecked door.</p>

<p>“There’s not a sound from in there!” Dennis moved
over to McCarty. “What’s he doing, do you suppose?
Fixing a train of powder, belike?”</p>

<p>“He is not!” McCarty responded. “If he’d meant to
blow us up he’d have done it down in his sitting-room instead
of turning that infernal smoke on us. He must
have had that all fixed and ready to blind us, so that he
could make whatever kind of a getaway he’d arranged.
You couldn’t hear a cannon go off behind that solid
steel, but whatever he’s doing, ’tis only to himself; you’ll
mind the letter he wrote me? He wouldn’t have spoke of
his diary unless he intended us to read it and it’s all
part and parcel of his character, Denny. He couldn’t
bear to go without the world knowing how clever he
was!”</p>

<p>“‘Clever!’” Dennis shuddered. “But what did he
do it all for, Mac? You asked him that when you accused
him and he didn’t answer. He’d no reason and
yet he wasn’t crazy! He’d such a grand manner and a
way of making you feel like the scum of the earth in his
presence without even trying to, that I would never have
suspected him in the world! How you came to guess it
is beyond me!”</p>

<p>“I’d the key to it all right from the start, only I didn’t
know it!” McCarty responded as the inspector bounded
up the stairs. “I’m only disgusted that the truth didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
come to me sooner, and maybe the little lad and the nurse
Lucette would have been spared.”</p>

<p>“Two of the best men in the department are on their
way!” the inspector announced. “I had to stop to send
in a second call for reserves to hold back the crowd that’s
trying to storm the gates, for the news has got out somehow!
Martin and Yost sent in the first call but the
boys who responded can do no more with that mob than
a one-armed sheriff in a riot!—Any sign from in there?”</p>

<p>The officials shook their heads and Jean remarked:</p>

<p>“I have seen once, when he goes in and does not know
that I am near to him. Before he close the door I think
that I see others still beyond this, but they are open and at
the end is a room with shelves covered with bottles and
glass tubes of a strange shape. On the floor is a great
round tank of some metal higher than one’s head! I
think then that he is perhaps a scientist, a great man! It
is only after Hughes die and then the little Horace disappear
that I begin to think he is a demon!—Here is
André.”</p>

<p>The stout chef had labored up the stairs and behind him
the flowing robes of Ching Lee moved like a shadow.</p>

<p>“You shall get him?” the former demanded. “You
shall put him in that chair of electricity? <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parbleu!</i>
When I think of the little Lucette so pretty and good,
and the little Horace, I could run my knives through
his heart! It is I who give him with these hands the
glass of milk with which he drugs the little Horace and
then I watch while that mountain of coal descend into
the chute and I suspect nothing! It is only when my
countrywoman die there before him and they say it is the
poison gas that I think of this room and the so horrible
odors which come from it when he open the door!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>“When did you see him come here last?” McCarty
asked.</p>

<p>“On the afternoon of Wednesday, but a half hour before
he cry out for help from the conservatory where
Lucette dies!” He spread out his small fat hands in an
expressive gesture. “I think it is to this room that he
comes for I am in mine with the door a little open and
he pass quickly and without sound; going up the stairs.
He carries something round and blue on the end of a stick
and I think that I must be mistake’ for it appears like the
toy balloon of a child! Nevertheless I watch and in a so
short time, a few minutes, he comes down again, still
carrying the balloon. I tell of it to Ching Lee later but
he has not seen it in the conservatory and he does not
believe.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Ching Lee, why didn’t you tell somebody
what you knew?” McCarty addressed the Chinaman
who stood aside, silent and seemingly impassive. “Why
did you let Orbit go on with his crimes when a word
to us would have put him where he could do no more
harm?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Orbit is rich, of a great family and power in high
places, and—he is a white man.” Ching Lee responded
in his unemotional singsong tones. “I too am of high
degree and not without honor in my own land but I was
forced to leave it and here I am a poor man, a servant
without friends or influence—and I am yellow. Who
would believe my word against his when I had no proof?
I would have been cast into your prison but even there
Mr. Orbit would have reached me and silenced my tongue.
There was the little Fu Moy to consider, my nephew who
is to be educated and go back with much to teach my
people; I could not leave him without protection. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
could only wait for you, who are white men, too, to see
what lay before your eyes.”</p>

<p>“There’s something in that!” McCarty conceded.
“Isn’t that the bell? If it’s the men we’ve sent for bring
them right up.”</p>

<p>“It is possible that he have shoot himself before we arrive
here,” remarked Jean. “There is a pistol which he
keeps always in a drawer of the little table beside his
bed and to-day when he thrust me aside at the door of
the card-room to rush out and learn why all those men
with shovels have come I feel it in his hip pocket as he
pushes his way past. It is loaded always; that I know,
for more than once I have looked at it.”</p>

<p>Dennis glanced questioningly at McCarty who shook
his head.</p>

<p>“He’s taking his body with him where he’s gone,”
he reminded the other in an undertone. “He’ll not do
that with the shot of a gun!”</p>

<p>Ching Lee reappeared with the two experts armed with
tools and bags. After a cursory examination of the steel
door one of the latter turned to the inspector.</p>

<p>“Can’t be done in less than an hour unless we take a
chance and blow it off, and you said there might be explosives
behind it that would wreck the block,” he announced.
“I don’t promise to do it in that time but
we’ll work as fast as we can.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and have a look at that diary in the meantime,”
suggested McCarty. “Jean thinks there are more
doors beyond like this one and it may be night before
they’re open! The boys can let us know when they’ve
got through.”</p>

<p>“All right.” The inspector turned, addressing the two
officials. “Want to come along? If it really is his diary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
it ought to be about the strangest document that ever
fell into the hands of the department.”</p>

<p>With a few minor directions to the rest he led the
way back to the sitting-room and closed the door. The
air was now quite clear of smoke and only a faint, noisome
odor lingered behind.</p>

<p>McCarty seated himself in the chair lately occupied
by Orbit himself and drew out the last drawer of the
desk. It was filled with open envelopes bearing cancelled
stamps and he scattered them on the floor in his haste to
empty it.</p>

<p>“He told the truth about the false bottom,” he announced.
“I can feel it give but I wonder how does it
open?”</p>

<p>One of the officials stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Shall I try, Mac?” he asked. “I was a custom house
inspector years ago and there isn’t a smuggler’s dodge I’m
not on to; that either lifts or slides and there may be a
spring.”</p>

<p>“Go to it,” McCarty acquiesced briefly, and the other
complied.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mac!” The inspector looked up suddenly.
“Who chloroformed Orbit the other night?”</p>

<p>McCarty chuckled.</p>

<p>“He did, himself! I got that the minute I saw the
bottle, for there wasn’t enough gone from it to put a
kitten out! The towel was soaked, but with water, and
he’d just sprinkled enough chloroform on it to smell.
He didn’t want to lose his wits, you see, only to make us
think he was unconscious so he could get a line on what
we were after and hear our talk. He must have heard
us coming up the stairs and looked out or else doped out
that it would be us, for it was Denny and me that broke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
in that night. He paid me a return call the next and
rigged up a gun to shoot me in the dark, but I found it
first and fired it through the roof!”</p>

<p>“’Twas that I heard!” Dennis exclaimed. “Glory be!
Well I knew you were too old a hand to let it go off
accidental, like you told me, but little I thought you’d
been near murdered, or I’d not have left you, duty or no
duty—!”</p>

<p>“There you are!” The detective lieutenant rose from
his knees with the false bottom of the drawer in his
hand. “It was a new one on me after all, but I managed
to work it. There’s a lot of papers underneath
that look as though they’d been torn from a blankbook
and they’re covered with writing.”</p>

<p>“It’s Orbit’s!” McCarty gathered the loose sheets up
and spread them on the desk before him. “Do you mind
when he wrote that list for me here in this very room, of
the guests he’d had during the last few months? The
writing is the same, and ’tis dated; it looks like the diary,
all right! Do you want to read it, inspector? I’m not
much good at it, and if he uses as big words as he talks
with—!”</p>

<p>Inspector Druet took the pages from him and seated
himself near the window. For a long moment he sat
silent glancing over the papers and as he read his face
darkened and then paled. Then with a sudden start he
looked over to McCarty.</p>

<p>“My God, this is frightful! The man was the greatest
wretch that ever lived! He must have been mad, of
course, but listen! This is dated the thirteenth; that
would be a week ago last Monday.—‘I succeeded in making
it to-day from the formula and tried it on the white
kitten from next door. The result was amazing! If it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
had been known a few years ago the history of the war
would have been changed! If I could only experiment
with it on a human, what a magnificent way it would be
for me to learn the thrill of that last experience that
awaits me! To take the place of providence, to play at
fate, to make destiny! The longing haunts me, I cannot
rest, I must know that ultimate sensation of power! I
can’t use the gas, though; I don’t need to see the death
I bring about and it must come far from the house. It
will have to be the Calabar bean after all, but whom shall
I choose? Not André, his soufflées are admirable, and
Jean is the only servant who ever dusted my room and
left things where I could find them; not Fu Moy or Ching
Lee, for one never knows with these silent, yellow people
when revenge will come. Hughes’ services are invaluable
to me but he is a dead loss to society, it might even
be benefited by his removal. I must decide!’”</p>

<p>“That was it!” McCarty nodded. “The longing for
power, to feel that he was the biggest man in the world;
ambition with a warped turn to it! ’Twas nothing but
the lust of killing born in him that he wouldn’t admit even
to himself!—But go on, sir. What’s the next?”</p>

<p>“Two days later, the fifteenth; that was Wednesday.
He says: ‘It must be Hughes. The neighbors are still
amusing after their fashion and I could not be sure they
would go outside of the Mall immediately. Physostigmine
is soluble in alcohol; I could put a grain or two in
wine and leave it about but that will not do. I must give
it to Hughes with my own hand. I shall have to await
my opportunity, then give him a drink and send him on
an errand to a strange part of town. I cannot wait!’—That’s
all of that entry and the next one is midnight
after the murder.—‘It is done! Hughes is dead and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
have killed him! I could shout, sing, dance as wildly as
a savage about a pyre and yet I am strangely calm, like a
god! I am a god, for I hold the power of life and death,
I know what it is at last! The only drawback was that
it was too easy; Hughes has been dissipating lately and
it gave me an idea to-night. I mixed some bitters together
with a dash of absinthe—just enough for one dose—added
two grains of the powdered bean and put it
in an old tonic bottle. When Hughes came to lay
out my things for dinner I told him he looked badly,
needed more air and exercise and persuaded him to go
out and take a long walk, breathing deeply. Then I
gave him the drink I had prepared,—poured it out for
him myself and watched it pass with a gurgle down his
gross, fat neck! I looked at him when he put down the
glass and could not realize that it was actually accomplished!
The man standing there before me was a
dead man even though he still moved and talked and
probably thought of his dinner, and it was I who had
done this! It had rested in my hands whether he
should live or die and I had condemned and executed
him! I shall never forget that moment of exquisite
exhilaration, the ecstasy of omnipotence! But I was
discreet, I controlled myself. I warned Hughes that
the medicine might make him feel a trifle ill, might even
restrict his breathing but he must walk it off and he
would be greatly benefited. He actually thanked me—thanked
me for bringing death upon him! All the
evening while Goddard and the Sloanes were here, I
kept my triumph to myself but nothing could withstand
my sense of power. My bridge was unsurpassed—I
knew that—and I played the organ as I never have played
before!—And then it came, that for which I had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
waiting. Three blockheads from the police arrived to
tell me of Hughes’ death!’”</p>

<p>McCarty chuckled grimly.</p>

<p>“Fu Moy overheard that conversation and told me
about it only to-day—between Orbit and Hughes, I mean,
about the medicine. He don’t say anything about the fire
after, does he?”</p>

<p>Dennis looked up quickly as the inspector glanced
ahead and nodded:</p>

<p>“Here it is.—‘There was only one flaw in this magic
evening. I used the powdered bean from the smaller
box and it was just enough. I did not open the other,
forgetting how long it had been since its contents had
been exposed to the air, but thrust it down in a seam
of the cushioned chair and almost immediately after I
had gone downstairs spontaneous combustion occurred.’”</p>

<p>“What-t!” Dennis sat forward tensely, and McCarty
chuckled again.</p>

<p>“I tried to read you that about Calabar bean in that
article we had at the fire house yesterday afternoon but
you wouldn’t listen!” he said. “I didn’t know what was
this spontaneous combustion at all, till you happened
to explain this morning, little thinking what was on my
mind!... But what else does Orbit say about it?”</p>

<p>“He goes on: ‘Fu Moy discovered it and Ching Lee
put it out. Fortunately they did not find the box of
Calabar bean.’—He raves on again about his feeling of
power, glorying in it, but that is all.” The inspector
slipped the page aside and glanced at the next. “This
is dated Sunday, the nineteenth. ‘The police were active
yesterday but they are quite at sea. I have no fear that
they will discover anything, although the one called McCarty
seems to be possessed of a certain amount of native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
shrewdness and logic. No uproarious comedy has
ever been so excruciatingly amusing as this investigation
but I am maintaining my pose of regretful employer
of a worthy servant. I only wish that I could have
used the gas; I made a fresh supply to-day only to be
compelled to dissipate it unused. It is maddening!
The death of Hughes has not satisfied this craving but
intensified it. Death by violence, death that I may experience
the sensation of having caused it, while it is
taking place—I hunger for it!’”</p>

<p>The shadows were lengthening in the room and the
cries of the mob outside the gates had subsided to a sullen
murmur. In the moment of silence that followed the
inspector’s reading of the paragraph, soft, slippered feet
padded along the hall and Ching Lee stood before them.</p>

<p>“The door has been opened,” he announced. “There
is a second steel one behind it, even stronger than the first,
but the men are trying a different acid and drill.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Ching Lee. Turn on the lights, will you?”
The inspector motioned toward the switch and in an
instant the room was flooded with a brilliant glow from
the low lamps scattered all about. “Tell the men to be
as quick as they can, and let me know when they have
finished; no one is to enter that room until we come.”</p>

<p>The butler bowed and turning went up the stairs
again. McCarty eyed the papers still remaining in the
inspector’s hands.</p>

<p>“Is there any entry in the diary for Monday?”</p>

<p>“Only this, but it means a lot, considering what came
later: ‘Ching Lee reminded me that the coal has not
been ordered this season. The dust from it is horrible,
defiling my flowers and soiling everything. I shall not
arrange for it until frost has come. Yet there is something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
fascinating, relentless, about the way it rushes
down the chute like a miniature, sable avalanche. If we
were pigmies, what death it could deal!’—Oh, there’s no
doubt about it, Mac; the man is unquestionably mad!”</p>

<p>“His ancestors weren’t; not all of them, at any rate!”
McCarty responded grimly. “If the next that he’s
written is on Tuesday night, it’ll be after Horace was
killed.”</p>

<p>“It is!” Inspector Druet’s voice shook with loathing.
“This is the most damnable thing, Mac! He must have
sat in that very chair where you are now, gloating over
it as he wrote!—‘Once more I have usurped the prerogative
of providence! I have taken a useless, sickly life,
foredoomed to failure because it lacked the stamina to
combat difficulties. Weakness! the only sin in the
world! Had Horace Goddard lived he would have profaned
art with mediocrity and as I look at the masterpieces
about me I rejoice that his poor efforts are destined
never to see the light,—destined because I so willed
it, I am destiny! It was the luminal that put the thought
into my mind, although I had no idea then whom I should
remove. I forgot I possessed any till I looked over the
store in my laboratory this morning. Two grains of
that innocent looking coal tar product would bring oblivion
in twenty minutes and the coma would last for two
or three hours, during which time death might be
brought about in a dozen different ways! I played with
the thought, it fascinated me, and I could fix my mind
on nothing else, although Giambattista was coming to
play this afternoon. If I could only know once more
those intoxicating moments of last Friday night!</p>

<p>“‘It was, then, just after lunch, that Horace slipped
over to ask if he might study my Fragonard for a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
while. He came by way of the side door and none of
the servants had seen him. I realized this and as I
looked at him it came to me what a really unnecessary
life his was, except in the fatuous eyes of his parents!
What a subject for that coal tar product—and then I
thought of the coal itself, that Ching Lee had spoken
about yesterday. How easy it would be to render Horace
insensible and bury him under an avalanche of coal!</p>

<p>“‘I could not resist the idea, it took possession of me!
I coaxed the boy up to my sitting-room, induced him to
drink a glass of milk in which I dropped two miraculous
grains of luminal, and then I went and telephoned the
coal-dealer. If he could not deliver, the boy would wake
none the worse and my plan would only be deferred, but
the order went through and when I rejoined him Horace
was already drowsy. I shall never forget the exquisite
agony of suspense during that half-hour. Horace slept
at last and although I had to call the coal-dealer twice
more my plan succeeded! I carried Horace to the cellar
unseen and just in time, for the coal arrived and the
crash of it tumbling down the chute was like the roll of
maddening drums! To hear it was enough, I did not
want to see, and I was again in my sitting-room spraying
the black dust from my flowers when the man McCarty
and his associate were ushered in. I am not quite sure
about McCarty; I have not underrated him, he is the
type of the one-time policeman, elemental, phlegmatic,
devoted to routine and without initiative, and yet he
seemed to-day to be studying me!’”</p>

<p>“He had me right!” McCarty grinned. “’Twas what
I went there for!”</p>

<p>“And me thinking you were stalling, and not getting
it at all!” Dennis shook his head. “He’d a grand opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
of himself, all right, but a poorly-read one of you,
Mac!”</p>

<p>“Orbit goes on to mention Trafford’s call to inquire
for Horace while you were here.” The inspector had
been reading ahead. “Then he starts on to rave about
the musicale and how he felt with the lad’s body under
his very feet; he says that at the organ he surpassed
Giambattista on the violin and he was drunk with what
he had pulled off all the evening.”</p>

<p>“He played all by himself later,” McCarty observed.
“A funny, childish little tune and yet with something
threatening and malicious about it, and whilst Denny
was getting shaved this morning I found out what it was—a
witch’s song from an opera called ‘Hansel and
Gretel,’ after the crone has lured children to her house
and made away with them! That ought to have told me
something if I’d known what it was!”</p>

<p>“He says nothing of planning another murder, does
he?” Dennis asked. “He must have run wild when he
committed one the very next day—!”</p>

<p>“The laboratory is open now, sir.” Ching Lee had
reappeared so noiselessly that he seemed to have sprung
into being on the threshold. “No one is there.”</p>

<p>“No one!” The inspector started up with a cry, cramming
the papers into his pocket. “My God, he has escaped,
after all!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, sir,” McCarty demurred gravely.
“Perhaps the men didn’t see him, but—we’d better lose
no time!”</p>

<p>They sprang up the stairs and passed the two great
steel doors swinging idly on twisted hinges, into a long,
low room, looking very much as Jean had described it.
The closed cupboards below the shelving were too small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
to have held a human body and there was no other hiding
place nor any way of egress save the door by which they
had entered.</p>

<p>“We’ve been done, Mac!” the inspector exclaimed
again, ruefully. “Unless the boys outside caught him,
we’ll have a long chase on our hands!”</p>

<p>“No.” McCarty stood looking up meditatively at
the huge circular vat which occupied the center of the
floor and rose for six or seven feet like a miniature gas
tank. “Give me that step-ladder, will you, Denny? I
want to see is this empty.”</p>

<p>“By the smell of it, it’s not!” Dennis commented.
“’Tis worse than asafœtida!”</p>

<p>He brought the ladder and McCarty ascended cautiously
and peered over the top. The vat appeared to be almost
filled with some thick, murky liquid with an oily film
floating on the surface. When he had stared down into
it for some minutes he descended, his ruddy face pale and
tinged with greenish shadows.</p>

<p>“Mac!” Dennis caught him solicitously as he reeled.
“It’s sick you are! Come away out of this! Orbit’s
not here!”</p>

<p>“If I’m sick it’s from my own thoughts, Denny!” McCarty
replied shakily. “Where does that pipe lead to
from the bottom of the vat?”</p>

<p>“To that huge receptacle over there.” It was the detective
lieutenant who answered, pointing. “It’s to draw
off whatever might be in there, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Turn the cock, then, will you?” McCarty sat down
suddenly and held his head in his hands. “I want to
see the bottom of that vat!”</p>

<p>The inspector looked startled and Dennis stared but
they made no comment and one official mounted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
ladder while the other turned the cock. There was a
gurgle and then a swishing rush as the liquid poured into
the slender, solid pipe.</p>

<p>“It’s going down,” the man on the ladder announced.
“Whatever this greasy stuff is, it’s slipping through the
pipe, all right! What do you think is at the bottom of
it, Mac?”</p>

<p>“I’m not wanting to think of it till I have to!” McCarty
groaned. “Sing out if—if it stops running out
before the vat’s empty.”</p>

<p>But the official, did not “sing out” and the waiting
seemed interminable. At last, after the longest half-hour
that any of them had known, he announced:</p>

<p>“Vat’s quite empty, Mac! Except for scum it’s as
clean as the floor! There’s six little things that look
like pebbles rolling around in it, though; shall I climb
down and get them?”</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, no!” McCarty sprang to his feet.
“’Tis sudden death and a horrible one, if you so much
as touch the stuff that’s left there! Go and ask André
for a lead spoon from the kitchen, and mind it’s lead!”</p>

<p>The man obeyed and McCarty threw off his coat,
climbed the ladder, and perched on the rim of the vat,
while Dennis uttered agonized warnings from below.
Then he drew up the ladder, planted it firmly inside the
vat and when the detective returned with the required
spoon he descended carefully to the lowest rung and
scooped up the six gray pellets from the slime of the
bottom.</p>

<p>When he had climbed over and down once more, guarding
his find with the utmost caution the others gathered
around him and he shuddered as he addressed the inspector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>“That vat is lined with lead, sir; nothing else but lead
could hold that stuff for it eats everything away as if it
hadn’t even been! You notice that ladder was purposely
fixed with lead tips to the feet of it or it would have
melted under me! I’ve heard of it but I never saw it before.
It’s hydrofluoric acid. ’Twill go through steel
and rock and—and flesh and bone, and leave no sign!
Do you get me?”</p>

<p>“I do, but it’s horrible!” The inspector shivered.
“You mean that Orbit—! Was that what he meant by
‘annihilation’?”</p>

<p>McCarty nodded.</p>

<p>“You’ll mind there’s only one thing can resist it and
that’s lead. This is all that is left of Henry Orbit—the
six bullets from his revolver!”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE ADVICE OF EX-ROUNDSMAN MCCARTY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“Shall</span> we go on?” the inspector asked. It was
nearly midnight and the intervening time since
that dreadful twilight hour in the laboratory had been
taken up with the formalities necessarily resultant upon
the final tragedy. He, McCarty and Dennis were alone
in Orbit’s sitting-room once more, for the two other
officials had returned to headquarters. As he spoke he
took from his pocket the remaining pages of the diary.</p>

<p>“That’s what Orbit wanted,” McCarty replied in a
subdued tone. “He’s left the soul of him, such as it was,
in those papers and though ’tis not a thing I’d like to let
loose on the world, we know the worst of him and we
ought to know the rest.”</p>

<p>Dennis was still benumbed from the successive shocks
of the day. He said nothing but his eyes, as the inspector
sorted the papers, followed the movements of his
hands in awed fascination.</p>

<p>“‘Wednesday night.’” The other settled himself to
read. “‘For the third time in a week I have taken life,
but the reaction is not the same. The mental exhilaration
came but the thrill is gone, or rather it has changed into
another sensation I have never known before. Is it fear?
I honestly do not know. To-day I finished generating
the gas for the third time and then, sure that I had the
formula by heart, I destroyed it so that my knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
should be absolute, mine alone. The longing for a worthwhile
experiment with it became an obsession and in
actual agony, torment, I seated myself at the organ to
seek peace.</p>

<p>“‘But for the first time music brought no relief to my
mind and I felt stifling. I went to one of the windows
to open it, and saw the French maid, Lucette, from next
door, with little Maude Bellamy. The child had a new
blue balloon and the thought came to me that if it were
filled with the poison gas and they were in a closed
room—! I invited them in to hear the organ and gave
Maude some candy. As I had hoped she forgot her toy
and dropped it. I picked it up and excused myself for a
moment—only a moment, just long enough to hasten to
my laboratory, deflate the balloon and fill it again with
the gas.</p>

<p>“‘When I returned to the conservatory Lucette and
the baby were still occupied with the candy. I handed
the balloon to the child and then seated myself once more
before the organ. Handel’s “Largo” came to me and
how I played! The thought that at any instant that toy
might burst tingled in my brain and I found myself listening
for it, tortured with suspense because it did not come.
I stole a glance at my guests finally. They were seated
side by side on the marble bench with the towering cactus
just behind them, its spikes reaching out over their shoulders.
If the balloon were to float toward one of them, if
a breath of air should waft it against one of those gigantic
thorns, as the child was holding it now, straight up into
the air—!</p>

<p>“‘A louder, almost crescendo movement came just
then in the music and I touched the swell pedal with my
foot, urging the keys beneath my fingers. The shutters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
the swell-box were forced open, the current of air rushed
out with the swift volume of sound. But rising even
above that glorious harmony there came a sudden, sharp
report! I dared not cease playing lest others in the house
might have heard it, I did not even dare to look around.
Never has the “Largo” seemed so interminable, but at last,
just as I came to the end, I heard—the patter of Maude’s
feet! The baby had escaped me!</p>

<p>“‘I whirled around then and saw her playing about
several feet away but Lucette was lying back dead, the
remnants of the balloon at her feet! I rushed then to
open the windows that the deadly vapors might not hang
upon the air to betray me and after the room was quite
clear of them I raised the alarm.</p>

<p>“‘McCarty and his associate were passing and in supreme
confidence I had them called in, glorifying in their
mystification. But the balloon disappeared! After the
doctor and the medical examiner’s assistant had gone,
after the body had been removed and the baby sent home
the balloon was missing and somehow I feel, I know that
McCarty has it! That he suspects!</p>

<p>“‘Sir Philip has come but he is writing an important
letter and I have taken the time to jot this down. I am
going out. I have McCarty’s address. I must know!</p>

<p>“‘Later. McCarty did have the balloon. He and his
associate went out leaving the entrance door unlatched
and one of the keys I took with me fitted the door of his
apartment. I found the remnant of the balloon and
brought it home, but that is of comparatively little importance
now. With the knowledge that he actually suspects,
this strange, new sensation came to me. Before,
mine was the supreme power, I killed at will, but now I
must kill to save myself! From being master I am become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
slave—but slave of what?—I shall have use once
more for that key!’”</p>

<p>“Sure, he did!” McCarty nodded. “I told you about
the revolver waiting for me on a pulley the next night, but
I’d like to know how ever he got hold of a police positive!”</p>

<p>“He tells that on the next page,” the inspector remarked.
“Here it is: ‘I have just laid a trap for him in
his rooms and he will blunder into it, but it has cost me
the service revolver I picked up in one of my solitary
walks down on the East Side, when a young policeman
had been killed by gangsters and the body just removed.
There is a retributive justice about my work to-night,
for last night McCarty and his associate broke in here.
I pretended to chloroform myself, hoping to hear from
their conversation why they had come and how strong
were their suspicions against me, but the man McCarty
opened my windows and hurried his associate away. Can
he have realized my ruse?</p>

<p>“‘I am afraid, I know it now, but not of McCarty personally.
Individual to individual he is infinitely my inferior
and yet there is about him a suggestion of strength
which takes from me my sense of power. Is it because
of what he represents? I am above the law and beyond
its reach, but is it because he stands for the law, for the
cumulative will of society, that my own will seems almost
puny?’”</p>

<p>“Grand words!” McCarty grunted. “He was getting
cold feet, that’s what! He’d let his craze for murder run
away with him, after all, and then lost his nerve when he
found he wasn’t putting it over!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, Mac!” Dennis shook his head.
“Any guy that can plan such a finish for himself as he
did don’t lack nerve, even if he was such a cold-blooded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
black-hearted devil! I’m thinking he guessed right; it
was the fear of the law, of every man’s hand being against
him, that made him put his back to the wall!”</p>

<p>“There’s just one more entry,” the inspector observed.
“That one was dated Thursday and this one is Friday,
the twenty-fourth.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be yesterday, or rather last night. Let’s have
it, inspector!”</p>

<p>“Well.—‘I have failed! This morning, alive and unharmed,
McCarty came to the Mall! I cannot hurt him, I
am powerless against him, he is the Law! But, for the
man himself, I have underrated him; he is more shrewd
and clever than I thought. To-day he came to me and in
Sir Philip’s presence, with infinite tact, he let me know
that he is aware it was I who made that attempt upon his
life. Seemingly he holds no grudge; it is apparently a
mere part of the game. He claims to have detected the
odor of cigar smoke which I left behind me in his rooms,
just as his associate smelled the smoke of that little blaze
generated from the physostigmine. He gave me to understand,
also, that he knew of my trick with the chloroform,
and he lied most unnecessarily about minor details,
with the full knowledge that I was aware of the truth.
To-night he appeared again with utterly trivial questions
and it is all too evident now that he is indeed studying
me, making up his mind.</p>

<p>“‘I have a peculiar, indescribable feeling, almost a conviction,
that he will win out in this contest between us!
If he does, I shall know what to do; from this hour I shall
be prepared. I am the last of my line and for such a
line there can be but one end,—annihilation! I am possessed
with an odd desire that he should read these pages
and if he wins I shall arrange to have them pass into his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
hands. It grows late and I am tired. I wonder what
to-morrow will bring?’—That is all, Mac. That is the
last word!”</p>

<p>“Well, he knows now!” McCarty drew a deep breath.
“I’m glad that’s over! It’s going to take me all my time
to forget these last ten days, I can tell you!”</p>

<p>“There’s more than one thing that’s not clear to me
yet,” Dennis remarked reflectively. “For instance, Mac,
you said Hughes had been took sick sudden. I heard
nothing about it.”</p>

<p>“You did, Denny, the same as me, only you didn’t get
it. All the other servants told of how greedy he was
starting in with his dinner, and how all of a sudden
he didn’t want any more, not even the things he was most
partial to; ’twas the Calabar bean first working in him,
making him sick. He got out into the air and walked
like he’d been told, poor devil, till he dropped in his
tracks! But he knew the truth in the end! Do you
mind the horror I saw in his face and how hard he tried to
speak and tell me?”</p>

<p>“But what really made you suspect the truth, Mac?”
the inspector asked. “Was it the toy balloon?”</p>

<p>“Partly. Then again, when Ching Lee called us into
the conservatory with Lucette lying there dead, it seemed
to me that Orbit was a trifle too calm and collected, for all
his fine-spoken words. He had his story down too pat
and he didn’t talk in short, jerky sentences, like a man
does when he’s almost beside himself; every word was
said for effect, as if he was acting a part. He forgot it
too quick, too. Even yesterday, when Sir Philip was
talking about Lucette’s death, he was more amused with
the way the Britisher was trying to express himself, than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
sorrowful over the murder, and the girl not two days
cold!</p>

<p>“After I left him I went to a little joint to get a bite
and whilst I waited I was feeling pretty rotten because
I couldn’t see my way clear like in the old days. It came
over me that I’d been getting rusty since I was out of
the game and I kind of wished I was back again, though
I remember well what a dog’s life it was in some ways.
That is just the phrase that come in my mind, ‘a dog’s
life’—and then I thought of Max!</p>

<p>“He was forever hovering around that coal chute as if
there was something down there he wanted—then I remembered
the coal getting put in, and the lad missing
right at that hour, and the whole thing broke over me!”</p>

<p>“But you said you’d had the key to it all right in your
hands from the start!” Dennis objected.</p>

<p>“I had. It was this!” McCarty reached in his pocket
and drew forth a thin pamphlet bound in blue paper.
“You’ve both kidded me about reading up on this psychology
stuff, to try to keep up with the boys down at headquarters,
but it was getting to me and I wanted everything
I could lay my hands on that seemed to have any bearing
on it. The first night, when we came here to let Orbit
know his valet was dead, I found this behind some other
books downstairs in the library and I—borrowed it. It
turned out to be nothing at all but the history of a family,
like a kind of a sermon on heredity, and I saw it had
been published in London. I began to read it, wondering
why Orbit would be interested in it, and I never heard the
like of such a crew! From sheep-stealing to assassinating
crowned heads, there was nothing they didn’t go in
for, and I’d say that not one in ten generations died in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
their beds! They were a rare old family, the Jessups!”</p>

<p>“‘Jessups!’” the inspector repeated. “Why, they’re
the family I spoke about this morning, though I couldn’t
recall the name!—the ones that are contrasted with the
grand record of the Parsons.”</p>

<p>“Sure, they are!” McCarty grinned. Then his face
sobered. “I knew it then, for I’d put in good time in
the library on Thursday looking them both up, but I didn’t
mention it because Orbit himself is the last of the Jessups.”</p>

<p>“Orbit—!”</p>

<p>“His grandmother on his mother’s side was the
daughter of old Gideon Jessups who was hung down
South for highway robbery and murder; another of his
daughters died insane and two of his sons were convicts—but
there’s no use going into it all. You’ll mind you
said the male members of the line died out long ago,
but it happens that no record was kept of the female side
of the house except this little book here. I’m going to
tell Parsons in the morning, for he’ll not spread such a
thing, and there’s something I want to know. If there’s
any sense at all to this heredity notion, it don’t look as if
Henry Orbit stood much of a chance!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“I can scarcely believe it yet, gentlemen!” Benjamin
Parsons exclaimed. “The news that Henry Orbit had
committed suicide in some mysterious manner, leaving a
written confession, came like a thunderclap but now that
you tell me the blood of the Jessups flows in his veins
it explains many things!”</p>

<p>“Did you ever meet Orbit, Mr. Parsons?” McCarty
asked. “Ever talk to him?”</p>

<p>“Once. It was two years ago but the experience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
though trivial in itself, was so curiously unpleasant that
it has never passed completely from my mind.” He
paused, glancing toward the window through which the
sunshine was pouring and listening to the not-far-distant
chiming of church bells. “I came home very late from
an evening meeting of a charitable organization. It was
raining in torrents, I had forgotten my key to the gates
and the watchman was standing in the shelter of a doorway
far down the block; I could not attract his attention
and I was drenched. All at once some one came up behind
me, said: ‘Allow me, Mr. Parsons!’ and opened
the gate for me. I was surprised, for the voice was unknown
to me, but in the light of the street lamp I recognized
Henry Orbit.</p>

<p>“You are familiar with his appearance, you have
heard his voice, felt the magnetism of his personality
and its dominance; did you feel also that strange sense
of antagonism that is almost physical, as though you
shrank from his touch, dreaded to breathe the same air?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say I have, Mr. Parsons,” the inspector replied
thoughtfully. “As though he were a reptile, something
poisonous, you mean? No, until yesterday I
thought Orbit was a fine man. He had me buffaloed.”</p>

<p>“I mean as though he were the incarnation of all things
evil!” Parsons’ voice was very low. “I did not gain
that impression at first so strongly, but I felt a curious
repugnance toward him in spite of the charm of his
manner. He walked down the block with me, taking it
for granted that his company was welcome and I responded
as cordially as I could, for he had just rendered
me a service.</p>

<p>“When we were opposite my own house I paused,
thanking him once more for his kindness, and started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
to take leave of him, when he astounded and distressed
me by asking me to come into his house for a little while.
He said that he was lonely, a saddened mood was upon
him and he would greatly appreciate it if I could spare
him half an hour.</p>

<p>“I could not very well refuse, but it was with a reluctance
wholly out of proportion that I accepted his invitation.
His house, although comparatively small, was
beautiful beyond any palaces I have seen abroad and
filled with priceless works of art but without any tangible
reason my aversion deepened to actual horror. A
tall Chinese servant had taken my hat and Henry Orbit
led me to his library, pressing refreshments on me and
talking fluently and well on a variety of topics. I endeavored
to listen, to reply pleasantly, but all the time
my uncharitable, unreasoning loathing of him increased
and I longed, as I have never longed for anything else in
this world, to be out in the storm once more—anywhere,
away from that house!</p>

<p>“I am sure this must sound like madness to you, but
I cannot explain it even to myself. I only know that
my horror deepened as the moments passed and at last
I did an unpardonable thing! I rose in the middle of
a sentence from him and without a word of explanation
or excuse I—I fled the house! I cannot yet describe
the motive which actuated me, nor could I then have
found any reason for it beyond an overmastering impulse.
I have never known such a feeling against a
stranger before in all my life!”</p>

<p>“You went out into the storm, Mr. Parsons—without
your hat?” McCarty asked suddenly. The inspector
smothered a half audible exclamation and Dennis
stared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<p>“I really forget—but I must have done so, of course,
for I distinctly remember the cold rain beating down
upon my bare head as I crossed the street, and being
most grateful for it.”</p>

<p>“Then you left your hat hanging up in Orbit’s house,”
McCarty pursued. “Can you recall what it was like, Mr.
Parsons? Could it have been a soft, dark felt?”</p>

<p>“Probably. I seldom wear any other.” Then Parsons
started slightly. “You don’t mean—! Could it
really have been my hat, after all, that the unfortunate
valet was wearing when he fell dead!”</p>

<p>“It looks that way, since your initials were in it,”
McCarty added: “That was the final detail we had not
cleared up.”</p>

<p>“But why, sir!” Dennis found his voice. “Why did
you feel that way towards Orbit? He took in everybody
else in the world!”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking I’ve got the answer to that, though it
may sound like blarney saying it to your face, Mr.
Parsons. We know who your family are and their
record. ’Tis one to be proud of!”</p>

<p>“It is one to be thankful for,” Mr. Parsons replied
modestly. “But I should like to hear your theory.”</p>

<p>“Well, we know who the Jessups were, too, and ’tis
my opinion that the good in you for which you’re not
responsible, and the evil in him which he couldn’t help,
just sort of recognized each other at once and what you
call your instinct warned you to get away.”</p>

<p>“It may be.” Mr. Parsons eyed him wonderingly.
“I think you have grasped it, Mr. McCarty; the good
and evil that men do live after them! I know it seemed
to me that satanic vapors were rising all about me in that
house and that I was in the presence of a monster! It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
never even occurred to me to make excuses for my conduct
or send for my hat!”</p>

<p>“There’s just one thing that I’m curious about, though
it has nothing to do with the murders. Have you missed
this? It was with your papers when they came into our
hands.” He produced the silver leaf and Parsons’ face
lighted up.</p>

<p>“Ah, that is the bookmark I slipped between the pages
of my encyclopædia! I told you that a leaf was torn from
it! I am glad, indeed, to regain this, for it is a souvenir
from a dear friend, an English army officer then stationed
in South Africa—”</p>

<p>“It comes from Table Mountain, don’t it, off of a silver
tree?” McCarty smiled also as he rose. “Mr. Parsons,
we’ll be keeping you no longer. The trouble’s been laid
for all time here in the Mall, I’m thinking, and there’ll
be no more evil come out of that house over the way.”</p>

<p>“And you three have brought peace to us again in a
miraculous manner!” Mr. Parsons held out his hand.
“Without you and the providence which led you to the
truth I shudder to think what further horrors might have
been visited upon us!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about providence!” McCarty’s eyes
twinkled. “I’m no hand at giving advice as a general
thing but if I was to offer a word of it to you, sir,
’twould be this:—in future, be mighty careful where you
hang your hat!”</p>
